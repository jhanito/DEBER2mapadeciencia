TI  - Rehabilitation Nutrition and Exercise Therapy for Sarcopenia.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.5534/wjmh.200190 [doi]
AB  - Sarcopenia is an age-related loss of skeletal muscle associated with adverse 
      outcomes such as falls, fractures, disability, and increased mortality in older 
      people and hospitalized patients. About half of older male nursing home residents 
      have sarcopenia. The diagnostic criteria by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia 
      in Older People (EWGSOP) and the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) have led 
      to increased interest in sarcopenia. Exercise and nutritional management are crucial 
      for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia. Nutritional therapy for sarcopenia 
      that includes 20 g of whey protein and 800 IU of vitamin D twice a day improves 
      lower limb strength. Exercise therapy for sarcopenia, such as resistance training 
      and 6 months of home exercises, improves muscle strength and physical function. 
      Combination therapy that includes both nutritional and exercise therapy improves 
      gait speed and knee extension strength more than either exercise alone or nutrition 
      therapy alone. Excessive bedrest and mismanagement of nutrition in medical 
      facilities can lead to iatrogenic sarcopenia. Iatrogenic sarcopenia is sarcopenia 
      caused by the activities of health care workers in health care facilities. 
      Appropriate nutritional management and exercise programs through rehabilitation 
      nutrition are important for prevention and treatment of iatrogenic sarcopenia. 
      Nutritional and exercise therapy should be started very early after admission and 
      adjusted to the level of inflammation and disease status. Repeated assessment, 
      diagnosis, goal setting, interventions, and monitoring using the rehabilitation 
      nutrition care process is important to maximize treatment effectiveness and improve 
      patients' functional recovery and quality of life.

TI  - A Guide to Different Intensities of Exercise, Vaccination, and Sports Nutrition in 
      the Course of Preparing Elite Athletes for the Management of Upper Respiratory 
      Infections during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19031888 [doi]

AB  - Elite athletes use high-intensity training to maintain their fitness level. However, 
      intense training can harm the immune system, making athletes suspectable to COVID-19 
      and negatively affecting their performance. In addition, the diet of athletes should 
      be appreciated more as it is another influencer of the immune system, especially 
      during the COVID 19 pandemic. The other important issue elite athletes face 
      currently is vaccination and its possible intervention with their training. The 
      present study attempts to discuss the impact of different training intensities, 
      nutritional strategies, and vaccination on the immune system function in elite 
      athletes. To this end, Scopus, ISC, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar 
      databases were searched from 1988 to 2021 using the related keywords. The results of 
      our review showed that although high-intensity exercise can suppress the immune 
      system, elite athletes should not stop training in the time of infection but use 
      low- and moderate-intensity training. Moderate-intensity exercise can improve immune 
      function and maintain physical fitness. In addition, it is also better for athletes 
      not to undertake high-intensity training at the time of vaccination, but instead 
      perform moderate to low-intensity training. Furthermore, nutritional strategies can 
      be employed to improve immune function during high-intensity training periods.

TI  - Aerobic Exercise Alters Brain Function and Structure in Parkinson's Disease: A 
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 203-216
LID - 10.1002/ana.26291 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Randomized clinical trials have shown that aerobic exercise attenuates 
      motor symptom progression in Parkinson's disease, but the underlying neural 
      mechanisms are unclear. Here, we investigated how aerobic exercise influences 
      disease-related functional and structural changes in the corticostriatal 
      sensorimotor network, which is involved in the emergence of motor deficits in 
      Parkinson's disease. Additionally, we explored effects of aerobic exercise on tissue 
      integrity of the substantia nigra, and on behavioral and cerebral indices of 
      cognitive control. METHODS: The Park-in-Shape trial is a single-center, double-blind 
      randomized controlled trial in 130 Parkinson's disease patients who were randomly 
      assigned (1:1 ratio) to aerobic exercise (stationary home trainer) or stretching 
      (active control) interventions (duration = 6 months). An unselected subset from this 
      trial (exercise, n = 25; stretching, n = 31) underwent resting-state functional and 
      structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and an oculomotor cognitive control 
      task (pro- and antisaccades), at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Aerobic 
      exercise, but not stretching, led to increased functional connectivity of the 
      anterior putamen with the sensorimotor cortex relative to the posterior putamen. 
      Behaviorally, aerobic exercise also improved cognitive control. Furthermore, aerobic 
      exercise increased functional connectivity in the right frontoparietal network, 
      proportionally to fitness improvements, and it reduced global brain atrophy. 
      INTERPRETATION: MRI, clinical, and behavioral results converge toward the conclusion 
      that aerobic exercise stabilizes disease progression in the corticostriatal 
      sensorimotor network and enhances cognitive performance. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:203-216.

TI  - Premenstrual Syndrome.
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) encompasses clinically significant somatic and 
      psychological manifestations during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, leading 
      to substantial distress and impairment in functional capacity. These symptoms 
      disappear within a few days of the onset of menstruation. The pooled prevalence of 
      reproductive age women affected with PMS worldwide amounts to 47.8%. Among these, 
      about 20% of women experience symptoms severe enough to disrupt their daily 
      activities, and the remaining have mild to moderate symptoms. Symptoms of PMS 
      include changes in appetite, weight gain, abdominal pain, back pain, low back pain, 
      headache, swelling and tenderness of the breasts, nausea, constipation, anxiety, 
      irritability, anger, fatigue, restlessness, mood swings and crying. The premenstrual 
      dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a more severe form of the same, which has been included 
      as a psychiatric disorder in the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical 
      manual for mental disorders (DSM-5). Many nonpharmacological and pharmacological 
      treatment methods are used to alleviate these symptoms. Nonpharmacological therapies 
      are the first line of management for mild symptoms, and those with severe symptoms 
      are treated with pharmacological therapy, mainly the selective serotonin reuptake 
      inhibitors (SSRIs). The various nonpharmacological therapies used to treat mild 
      symptoms include physical activity and exercise, nutrition, herbal preparations, 
      cognitive behavioral therapy and social support, adequate rest, regular hot baths, 
      and vitamin supplements.

TI  - Combining exercise and nutrition in chronic kidney disease and dialysis: Can we 
      learn from the performance nutrition of athletes?
LID - 10.1111/sdi.13060 [doi]
AB  - The benefits of exercise interventions in individuals with chronic kidney disease 
      have been widely reviewed; however, exercise has not yet been incorporated into 
      routine clinical practice. In athletic populations, the goals of exercise training 
      are to improve a specific aspect of physical performance such as strength or 
      endurance, to ultimately optimize physical performance. This contrasts with many 
      chronic kidney disease exercise studies where the goals are more aligned to a 
      minimal effect, such as prevention of decline in physical function, frailty or 
      protein energy wasting (PEW), weight loss for cardiovascular disease risk reduction, 
      and risk minimization for mortality. In athletic populations, there are common 
      targeted nutrition strategies used to optimize physical performance. In this review, 
      we consider the evidence for and potential benefits of targeted nutrition strategies 
      to complement well-designed exercise interventions to improve physical performance 
      in people with chronic kidney disease and dialysis. Overall, we found a small number 
      of studies using targeted protein supplementation in combination with a variety of 
      exercise protocols; however, results were mixed. Future studies in people with 
      chronic kidney disease should optimize acute (pre, during, and postexercise) and 
      chronic nutritional status, utilizing targeted nutrition interventions proven in 
      athletes to have benefit.

TI  - Preliminary Efficacy and Acceptability of an Online Exercise and Nutrition Workplace 
      Wellness Program: A Brief Report.
PG  - 90-96
LID - 10.1177/21650799211037528 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Workplace wellness programs (WWP) offer physiological and psychological 
      benefits to employees and financial and productivity benefits to employers. However, 
      the COVID-19 pandemic has prevented in-person sessions and has required WWP's to 
      transition to online platforms. The purpose of this brief report was to assess the 
      preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a mobile version of the 
      Bruin Health Improvement Program (BHIP mobile) WWP. METHODS: Participants virtually 
      attended (i.e., via Zoom) twice weekly physical activity sessions and a once weekly 
      nutrition seminar for 10-weeks with the option of a 30-minute one-on-one 
      consultation with a registered dietician. Demographics, anthropometric indices, 
      stress, muscular endurance, and aerobic fitness were assessed at baseline and 
      follow-up. All analyses were conducted in SPSS v. 27. RESULTS: Twenty-seven 
      participants (96% female) enrolled and 13 (100% female) completed the 10-week 
      program. There were significant reductions in bodyweight (p < .01) and body mass 
      index (p < .02) but not stress (p > .05), and significant increases in muscular 
      endurance (p < .01) but not aerobic fitness (p > .05). Overall, BHIP mobile appears 
      to be acceptable to participants but logistical concerns such as inconsistent 
      internet connection was noted as potential downfalls. CONCLUSIONS/APPLICATIONS TO 
      PRACTICE: Improvements in health outcome among completers of a mobile WWP were 
      promising. Completer feedback highlighted program strengths as the flexibility and 
      comfort of attending exercise sessions and nutrition classes from home. Future 
      versions of the program will allocate resources to improve completion and expand 
      appeal for men and women.

TI  - Stress Management.
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Effective techniques for stress management are varied. They typically include 
      behaviors that improve physical health, such as nutrition and exercise, but may also 
      incorporate strategies that improve cognitive and emotional functioning. The 
      stress-reduction approach based on mindfulness practices has recently enjoyed an 
      explosion of interest from a variety of healthcare and epidemiological researchers. 
      The concept of mindfulness, which originates from practices of Buddhism, is defined 
      as a focused awareness of one’s experience, and purposeful and nonjudgmental focus 
      on the present moment. Structured interventions, such as the Mindfulness-Based 
      Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, provide participants with the opportunity to learn 
      breathing meditation, body scanning techniques, and gentle, yoga-inspired physical 
      exercises. With practice, individuals learn to process emotions, thoughts, and 
      sensations as they arise. Individuals learn to modify their reflexive conditioning 
      from automatically reacting or worrying about the future to a more adaptive, 
      measured response with greater awareness of the present moment. The literature is 
      replete with evidence suggesting that, with practice, individuals can become more 
      mindful, increasing their capacity to fully process emotions, thoughts, and 
      sensations as they arise. MBSR interventions have been adapted to a wide variety of 
      individuals, from those suffering from chronic or debilitating health conditions to 
      healthy undergraduate or medical students. Randomized controlled trials of MBSR 
      interventions have demonstrated improvements to psychological and physiological 
      processes with relevance to health outcomes and improved stress management. Some 
      individuals have a greater innate, or trait, capacity for mindfulness. These 
      individuals, who have not participated in mindfulness-training interventions, tend 
      to experience better physical health, report fewer physiological symptoms such as 
      pain, and utilize fewer healthcare resources. Trait mindfulness has been associated 
      with lower ratings of anxiety and depression in a variety of medical and non-medical 
      populations. Trait mindfulness may emerge from a genetic predisposition. A recent 
      epidemiological study of adolescent twins revealed that trait mindfulness was 32% 
      heritable. The same study also revealed that 66% of the variance in trait 
      mindfulness was due to environmental factors, suggesting that is also a skill that 
      can be learned. In fact, an MBSR study in university undergraduates revealed that, 
      while increases in mindfulness and psychological outcomes can be observed in 
      participants as a whole, effects may be more pronounced among individuals higher in 
      trait mindfulness at study entry. These data substantiate the utility of mindfulness 
      training, even for high-trait individuals.

TI  - Correlates of Aerobic and Strength Exercise in Korean Cancer Patients: Data From the 
      2014-2016 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
PG  - E255-E262
LID - 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000909 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the prevalence and correlates of exercise in Korean cancer 
      patients is important to improve their health-related fitness and quality of life. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and correlates of 
      aerobic and strength exercise in Korean cancer patients. METHODS: Overall, 640 
      cancer patients from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
      2014-2016 were categorized as meeting the exercise guidelines as follows: (a) 
      neither, (b) strength only, (c) aerobic only, or (d) combined. Correlates included 
      demographic, medical, health-related fitness, and quality of life variables. 
      Univariate and stepwise multinomial logistic regression were used for statistical 
      analyses. RESULTS: Over 70% of Korean cancer patients did not meet either exercise 
      guideline. Higher education was associated with being more likely to meet the 
      combined (odds ratio [OR], 4.69; P < .001), aerobic-only (OR, 3.58; P < .001), and 
      strength-only (OR, 1.87; P = .042) guidelines. Higher hand-grip strength (per 10 kg) 
      was associated with being more likely to meet the combined (OR, 1.78; P = .003) and 
      strength-only (OR, 1.73; P < .001) guidelines. Older age (per 10 years) was 
      associated with being less likely to meet the combined (OR, 0.69; P = .009) and 
      aerobic-only (OR, 0.59; P < .001) guidelines and more likely to meet the 
      strength-only guideline (OR, 1.46; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise levels are very 
      low among Korean cancer patients and are correlated with age, education, and 
      physical strength. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Oncology nurses in Korea should 
      consider promoting exercise to cancer patients, especially older, less educated, and 
      physically weaker patients.

TI  - What should a family physician know about nutrition and physical exercise 
      rehabilitation' advices to communicate to 'long-term COVID-19' patients?
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1080/00325481.2022.2035589 [doi]
AB  - In real practice, there is a paradox in the management of patients with 'long-term 
      Covid-19.' Indeed, Family physicians (FPs) are on the front line in the management 
      process of these patients. For 'long-term Covid-19' patients, and according to the 
      World Health Organization guideline, the cardiopulmonary rehabilitation (CPR) should 
      be provided not only at tertiary- or secondary care but mainly at primary care with 
      a real implication of FPs. However, specific guidelines/recommendations were 
      addressed for FPs. Therefore, an alternative including the CPR minimal advice that 
      an FP should provide to 'long-term Covid-19' patients, seems to be necessary to 
      respond to the needs of FPs to face their involvement with 'long-term Covid-19' 
      patients. Thus, this paper aimed to report the CPR 'minimal advice' that should be 
      provided by FPs managing 'long-term Covid-19' patients with incapacity (i.e.; 
      alteration of the cardiorespiratory and muscular chain). According to the authors, 
      FPs should be more cautious in the prescription of exercise and nutrition program 
      and informed about the minimal advices related to nutritional and physical exercise 
      rehabilitation guidelines when taking care of 'long-term Covid-19' patients, and how 
      these guidelines can relieve the mental and physical problems, improve immunity, and 
      accelerate the recovery process of the patients. With the occurrence of new variants 
      of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the nutritional and exercise 
      rehabilitation guidelines implemented by FPs become indispensable to promote the 
      recovery of Covid-19 patients and support a return to normal life.

TI  - Female Athlete Triad.
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Female athletes often complain of low energy availability, which is defined as 
      energy from oral nutrition less energy used for exercise. As such, low energy may 
      result (whether intentionally or unintentionally) from more energy expenditure, less 
      oral nourishment, or both. A chronic energy deficit can occur in the female athlete 
      with musculoskeletal and reproductive dysfunction. Low energy (with or without an 
      eating disorder) in combination with a menstrual disorder and altered mineral bone 
      density is known as the female athlete triad. Early identification of low energy in 
      the female athlete and thorough understanding of the syndrome and its progression is 
      important to prevent short- and long-term consequences.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to examine the effect of healthy lifestyle 
      beliefs on their attitudes toward physical activity, nutrition, exercise, and 
      weight-related self-efficacy lifestyles in Turkish adolescents. METHODS: This study 
      used a methodological and descriptive design. The study was conducted with 445 
      adolescents aged 13-18 years. The data were collected using a Descriptive 
      Information Form, the Healthy Lifestyle Beliefs Scale for Adolescents, the Nutrition 
      Exercise Attitudes Scale, and the Attitudes Toward Physical Activity Scale. Mean and 
      percentage values, t-test, ANOVA test, and linear regression analysis were used in 
      the analysis of the research data. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference 
      was found between adolescents' obesity status, paternal educational level, maternal 
      educational level, income status, and the mean scores obtained for healthy lifestyle 
      beliefs, nutrition and exercise attitudes, physical activity attitudes, and 
      weight-related self-efficacy, as well as between sex and mean scores for attitudes 
      toward nutrition, exercise, and physical activity. In the model created with 
      regression analysis, it was found that the adolescents' healthy lifestyle beliefs 
      and sociodemographic variables explained 96.3% of their attitudes toward nutrition 
      and exercise, 93.6% of physical activity attitudes, and 96.5% of weight-related 
      self-efficacy levels, with statistical significance. CONCLUSION: According to the 
      results of the study, healthy lifestyle beliefs are an important predictor of 
      adolescents' attitudes toward nutrition, exercise, and physical activity as well as 
      their weight-related self-efficacy. We recommend that school nurses consider healthy 
      lifestyle beliefs when creating intervention programs for adolescents .

TI  - GDF15 in Appetite and Exercise: Essential Player or Coincidental Bystander?
LID - bqab242 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/endocr/bqab242 [doi]
AB  - Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) has recently moved to the forefront of 
      metabolism research. When administered pharmacologically, GDF15 reduces food intake 
      and lowers body weight via the hindbrain-situated receptor GFRAL (glial cell-derived 
      neurotrophic factor family receptor alpha-like). Endogenous GDF15 is a ubiquitous 
      cellular stress signal that can be produced and secreted by a variety of cell types. 
      Circulating levels are elevated in a series of disease states, but also in response 
      to exogenous agents such as metformin, colchicine, AICAR, and cisplatin. Recently, 
      exercise has emerged as a relevant intervention to interrogate GDF15 physiology. 
      Prolonged endurance exercise increases circulating GDF15 to levels otherwise 
      associated with certain pathological states and in response to metformin treatment. 
      The jury is still out on whether GDF15 is a functional "exerkine" mediating 
      organ-to-brain crosstalk or whether it is a coincidental bystander. In this review, 
      we discuss the putative physiological implication of exercise-induced GDF15, 
      focusing on the potential impact on appetite and metabolism.

TI  - Additive Effects of Exercise or Nutrition Intervention in a 24-Month 
      Multidisciplinary Treatment with a Booster Intervention for Children and Adolescents 
      with Overweight or Obesity: The ICAAN Study.
LID - 10.3390/nu14020387 [doi]
LID - 387
AB  - This study compared the effects of a real-world multidisciplinary intervention with 
      additional exercise or nutritional elements and investigated the effectiveness of a 
      booster intervention after weight regain. A total of 242 children and adolescents 
      (age- and sex-specific body mass index [BMI] ≥ 85th percentile, mean age: 10.82 
      years, 60% male) were allocated to three groups: usual care, exercise, or nutrition. 
      Six-month active treatment with 1:1 session and a maintenance stage with group 
      activities were repeated twice to comprise a 24-month intervention. The primary 
      outcome was change % of the BMI z-score (zBMI). A total of 110 (45.4%) participants 
      completed the 24-month intervention. A mixed-effects model analysis indicated no 
      significant interaction effect of the intervention group and treatment phase on the 
      zBMI change % (p = 0.976). However, there was a significant main effect of the 
      treatment phase on zBMI change % at 6 months (β = -2.98, [95% CI, -5.69-0.27]), 18 
      months (β = -3.99, [95% CI, -6.76-1.22]), and 24 months (β = -3.23, [95% CI, 
      -5.94-0.52]; p = 0.042). The improvements in zBMI, body fat %, and cardiometabolic 
      markers were observed only among males. Whereas the additive effect of intensive 
      exercise or nutritional feedback was not detected in the long term, a booster 
      intervention with 1:1 counseling was effective even after weight regain during the 
      maintenance period. It may be useful to combine individualized counseling with a 
      less intensive form of group care for long-term maintenance in a real-world setting.

TI  - Nutrition and Physical Activity Clinical Practice Guidelines for Older Adults Living 
      with Frailty.
PG  - 3-11
LID - 10.14283/jfa.2021.51 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We developed clinical practice guidelines to provide health care 
      providers with evidence-based recommendations for decisions related to the effective 
      management of frailty and pre-frailty using nutrition and physical activity 
      interventions. METHODS: We based the recommendations on two systematic reviews with 
      meta-analyses. Nutrition, physical activity, and combined nutrition and physical 
      activity interventions for adults ≥65y were considered if study populations were 
      identified as frail using a frailty tool or assessment. Risk of bias and certainty 
      of evidence were evaluated. We included physical outcomes, mobility, frailty, 
      cognitive function, activities of daily living, falls, quality of life, diet 
      quality, energy/fatigue levels, health services use, and caregiver outcomes. 
      RESULTS: Overall, mobility improvements were moderate with nutritional strategies 
      that optimize dietary intake, various types of physical activity interventions, and 
      interventions that combine nutrition and physical activity. Physical outcomes, such 
      as body mass and muscle strength, improved moderately with nutritional strategies 
      and interventions that combined nutrition with physical activity. Frailty status 
      improved with multi-component physical activity interventions. Strong 
      recommendations include optimizing dietary intake, performing physical activity, and 
      adopting interventions that combine nutrition and physical activity. We strongly 
      recommend various types of physical activity including muscle strengthening 
      activities, mobilization or rehabilitation exercises, and multi-component physical 
      activity interventions. INTERPRETATION: Tailored nutrition and physical activity 
      interventions based on individual goals and health status are associated with 
      improved clinical and physical outcomes. While the recommendations facilitate shared 
      decision-making, we identified sparse application of validated frailty assessments 
      and lack of standardized research outcomes as critical gaps in knowledge.

TI  - Metabotyping for Precision Nutrition and Weight Management: Hype or Hope?
LID - 10.1007/s13668-021-00392-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Precision nutrition requires a solid understanding of the factors 
      that determine individual responses to dietary treatment. We review the current 
      state of knowledge in identifying human metabotypes - based on circulating 
      biomarkers - that can predict weight loss or other relevant physiological outcomes 
      in response to diet treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Not many studies have been conducted 
      in this area and the ones identified here are heterogeneous in design and 
      methodology, and therefore difficult to synthesize and draw conclusions. The basis 
      of the creation of metabotypes varies widely, from using thresholds for a single 
      metabolite to using complex algorithms to generate multi-component constructs that 
      include metabolite and genetic information. Furthermore, available studies are a mix 
      of hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating studies, and most of them lack 
      experimental testing in human trials. Although this field of research is still in 
      its infancy, precision-based dietary intervention strategies focusing on the 
      metabotype group level hold promise for designing more effective dietary treatments 
      for obesity.

TI  - Pre-flight exercise and bone metabolism predict unloading-induced bone loss due to 
      spaceflight.
PG  - 196-203
LID - 10.1136/bjsports-2020-103602 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bone loss remains a primary health concern for astronauts, despite 
      in-flight exercise. We examined changes in bone microarchitecture, density and 
      strength before and after long-duration spaceflight in relation to biochemical 
      markers of bone turnover and exercise. METHODS: Seventeen astronauts had their 
      distal tibiae and radii imaged before and after space missions to the International 
      Space Station using high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT. We estimated bone 
      strength using finite element analysis and acquired blood and urine biochemical 
      markers of bone turnover before, during and after spaceflight. Pre-flight exercise 
      history and in-flight exercise logs were obtained. Mixed effects models examined 
      changes in bone and biochemical variables and their relationship with mission 
      duration and exercise. RESULTS: At the distal tibia, median cumulative losses after 
      spaceflight were -2.9% to -4.3% for bone strength and total volumetric bone mineral 
      density (vBMD) and -0.8% to -2.6% for trabecular vBMD, bone volume fraction, 
      thickness and cortical vBMD. Mission duration (range 3.5-7 months) significantly 
      predicted bone loss and crewmembers with higher concentrations of biomarkers of bone 
      turnover before spaceflight experienced greater losses in tibia bone strength and 
      density. Lower body resistance training volume (repetitions per week) increased 3-6 
      times in-flight compared with pre-spaceflight. Increases in training volume 
      predicted preservation of tibia bone strength and trabecular vBMD and thickness. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the fundamental relationship between mission 
      duration and bone loss. Pre-flight markers of bone turnover and exercise history may 
      identify crewmembers at greatest risk of bone loss due to unloading and may focus 
      preventative measures.

      Study.
PG  - 752500
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2021.752500 [doi]
LID - 752500
AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the impact of different intervention methods on physical health 
      indexes of perimenopausal women. METHODS: Seventy-eight perimenopausal women were 
      divided into three groups. Group A received routine gynecological diagnosis and 
      treatment and participated in centralized lifestyle health education. Group B was 
      required to participate in all intensive education content, and professional 
      dietitians gave individualized dietary guidance. Group C received intensive 
      education, individualized diet intervention and intensified resistance exercise. 
      Dietary scores, exercise habits, waist circumference, body mass index, fat and 
      muscle mass were observed after three months. RESULTS: After the intervention, the 
      total diet score of group C was higher than groups A and B, and the red meat score 
      was significantly reduced. The number of patients in groups B and C who exercised >3 
      times per week and the number of resistance exercises were significantly increased, 
      while the number of aerobic exercises per week in group C was significantly 
      increased. The body fat and waist circumference were significantly reduced, and 
      skeletal muscle weight was significantly increased. Body mass index, trunk fat ratio 
      and waist-to-hip ratio were significantly decreased in groups B and C, while trunk 
      muscle was significantly increased in group C. CONCLUSION: The combined intervention 
      of the three methods can give full play to the synergistic effect of various 
      interventions. The improvement effect of increasing the appropriate amount of 
      resistance exercise is more obvious, which is worthy of further promotion and 
      application.

TI  - Exercise medicine for cancer cachexia: targeted exercise to counteract mechanisms 
      and treatment side effects.
LID - 10.1007/s00432-022-03927-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cancer-induced muscle wasting (i.e., cancer cachexia, CC) is a common and 
      devastating syndrome that results in the death of more than 1 in 5 patients. 
      Although primarily a result of elevated inflammation, there are multiple mechanisms 
      that complement and amplify one another. Research on the use of exercise to manage 
      CC is still limited, while exercise for CC management has been recently discouraged. 
      Moreover, there is a lack of understanding that exercise is not a single medicine, 
      but mode, type, dosage, and timing (exercise prescription) have distinct health 
      outcomes. The purpose of this review was to examine the effects of these modes and 
      subtypes to identify the most optimal form and dosage of exercise therapy specific 
      to each underlying mechanism of CC. METHODS: The relevant literatures from MEDLINE 
      and Scopus databases were examined. RESULTS: Exercise can counteract the most 
      prominent mechanisms and signs of CC including muscle wasting, increased protein 
      turnover, systemic inflammation, reduced appetite and anorexia, increased energy 
      expenditure and fat wasting, insulin resistance, metabolic dysregulation, gut 
      dysbiosis, hypogonadism, impaired oxidative capacity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and 
      cancer treatments side-effects. There are different modes of exercise, and each mode 
      has different sub-types that induce vastly diverse changes when performed over 
      multiple sessions. Choosing suboptimal exercise modes, types, or dosages can be 
      counterproductive and could further contribute to the mechanisms of CC without 
      impacting muscle growth. CONCLUSION: Available evidence shows that patients with CC 
      can safely undertake higher-intensity resistance exercise programs, and benefit from 
      increases in body mass and muscle mass.

AB  - Cycling is predominantly an endurance sport in which fuel utilization for energy 
      production relies on the availability and delivery of oxygen to exercising muscle. 
      Nutrition and training interventions to improve endurance performance are 
      continually evolving, but ultimately, prescription should aim to generate 
      improvements in cycling power and velocity while prioritizing athlete health and 
      well-being. The wide range of cycling events and the different environments in which 
      events take place pose a variety of nutrition-related challenges for cyclists. This 
      review addresses some of these challenges and highlights recent advancements in 
      nutrition for cycling performance.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of telehealth-delivered diet and exercise interventions: A 
      systematic review.
PG  - 1357633X211070721
LID - 10.1177/1357633X211070721 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Telehealth is a promising tool for delivering lifestyle interventions 
      for the management of health conditions. However, limited evidence exists regarding 
      the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. This systematic review aimed to 
      evaluate the current literature reporting on the cost-effectiveness of 
      telehealth-delivered diet and/or exercise interventions. METHODS: Four electronic 
      databases (PubMed, CENTRAL, CINAHL and Embase) were searched for published 
      literature from database inception to November 2020. This review adhered to the 
      preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines and 
      the ISPOR Criteria for Cost-Effectiveness Review Outcomes Checklist. The quality of 
      reporting was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting 
      Standards checklist. The extracted data were grouped into subcategories according to 
      telehealth modality, organised into tables and reported narratively. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-four studies of controlled trials (11 combined diet and exercise, 9 
      exercise-only and 4 diet-only telehealth-delivered interventions) were included for 
      data extraction and quality assessment. Interventions were reported as 
      cost-effective in 12 studies (50%), five studies (21%) reported inconclusive 
      results, and seven studies (29%) reported that the interventions were not 
      cost-effective. Telephone interventions were applied in eight studies (33%), seven 
      studies (29%) used internet interventions, six studies (25%) used a combination of 
      internet and telephone interventions, and three studies (13%) evaluated mHealth 
      interventions. Quality of study reporting varied with between 54% and 92% of 
      Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards items reported. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests that telehealth-delivered lifestyle interventions 
      can be cost-effective compared to traditional care. There is a need for further 
      investigations that employ rigorous methodology and economic reporting, including 
      appropriate decision analytical models and longer timeframes.

AB  - Few studies evaluating the relationship between depression and exercise consider 
      peoples' socio-demographic characteristics. This cross-sectional study investigated 
      the interaction between exercise and marital status and depression in Taiwanese 
      adults. Data from the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) was recruited from 
      the Taiwan Biobank. Participants indicated their exercise status, showing 5015 
      no-exercise cases and 3407 exercise cases. Marital status, including unmarried, 
      divorced or separated, and widowed, were all significant, especially among the 
      no-exercise group. The relationship between exercise/no exercise and marital status 
      was examined; no exercise and unmarried, divorced or separated, and widowed, as well 
      as exercise and married were significant to PHQ-2. Gender was significant in both 
      the married and unmarried groups. The association between exercise, marital status, 
      gender, and education on PHQ-2 score was also significant. Married people, 
      especially men, had lower depression scores. Additionally, exercise had a protective 
      effect against depression for unmarried people, especially women.

TI  - Owners' views of canine nutrition, weight and wellbeing and their implications for 
      the veterinary consultation.
LID - 10.1111/jsap.13469 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate owners' views around canine nutrition and wellbeing, how 
      these beliefs may differ according to the weight status of the dog and the 
      implications for owner support approaches. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      researcher-mediated questionnaire collected quantitative and qualitative data via 
      structured interviews with dog owners (n=147) attending a country park in the East 
      Midlands, UK, with a specific focus on views around canine nutrition and wellbeing. 
      RESULTS: Forty-four percent of owners cited "past experience" when determining what 
      to feed, and only 9% of owners cited the veterinarian as a source of this 
      information. When comparing chosen verbal description versus non-sequential body 
      condition score images of the dog, only 22% of owners with overweight animals 
      matched perceived verbal and visual appraisals, compared with 89% of owners of ideal 
      weight dogs. Owners cited a good diet and regular exercise as important factors for 
      canine wellbeing, but companionship with other dogs as the least important factor. 
      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Owners report being aware of the important association 
      between canine nutrition and wellbeing, but their considered importance of factors 
      influencing dog wellbeing may be influenced by their perceived weight status of the 
      animal. Veterinarians may need to reframe owner discourse such that there is more 
      routine discussion around weight and nutrition at every consultation. Furthermore, 
      the use of non-sequential body condition score images could be a useful tool for a 
      more considered opinion of canine weight status by owners.

TI  - How gender, education and nutrition knowledge contribute to food insecurity among 
      adults in Australia.
LID - 10.1111/hsc.13715 [doi]
AB  - Food and nutrition insecurity occurs when healthy and safe food cannot be obtained 
      by socially acceptable means and arises as a result of complex interactions between 
      socioeconomic and demographic determinants. These factors contribute to 
      discrepancies in health and well-being between men and women and may also explain 
      differential rates of food insecurity. The objectives of this cross-sectional study 
      were to investigate the intersection between gender, education, nutrition knowledge 
      and food security status within a high-income country context. Australian adults 
      over 16 years of age who identified as having primary responsibility for food in 
      their household were recruited via social media and a panel. Respondents completed a 
      self-administered survey that included sociodemographic data, nutrition-related 
      knowledge and food security status. Food security was measured using the Australian 
      Household Food and Nutrition Security Scale an adapted version of the United States 
      Department of Agriculture Household Food Security Survey. Among the 1010 survey 
      respondents, household food insecurity (HFI) was highly prevalent (43% were food 
      insecure, with 26% of these severely food insecure). Gender may affect associations 
      between education, nutrition knowledge and HFI. Education was significantly 
      associated with HFI among women but not among men. Conversely, nutrition knowledge 
      was significantly inversely associated with food security among men but not among 
      women. Differences in determinants of HFI exist between men and women, and programs 
      aimed at addressing food insecurity may be more effective if tailored accordingly to 
      account for the social and demographic factors associated with HFI.

TI  - Impact of Physical Activity and Exercise on the Epigenome in Skeletal Muscle and 
      Effects on Systemic Metabolism.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10010126 [doi]
LID - 126
AB  - Exercise and physical activity induces physiological responses in organisms, and 
      adaptations in skeletal muscle, which is beneficial for maintaining health and 
      preventing and/or treating most chronic diseases. These adaptations are mainly 
      instigated by transcriptional responses that ensue in reaction to each individual 
      exercise, either resistance or endurance. Consequently, changes in key metabolic, 
      regulatory, and myogenic genes in skeletal muscle occur as both an early and late 
      response to exercise, and these epigenetic modifications, which are influenced by 
      environmental and genetic factors, trigger those alterations in the transcriptional 
      responses. DNA methylation and histone modifications are the most significant 
      epigenetic changes described in gene transcription, linked to the skeletal muscle 
      transcriptional response to exercise, and mediating the exercise adaptations. 
      Nevertheless, other alterations in the epigenetics markers, such as 
      epitranscriptomics, modifications mediated by miRNAs, and lactylation as a novel 
      epigenetic modification, are emerging as key events for gene transcription. Here, we 
      provide an overview and update of the impact of exercise on epigenetic 
      modifications, including the well-described DNA methylations and histone 
      modifications, and the emerging modifications in the skeletal muscle. In addition, 
      we describe the effects of exercise on epigenetic markers in other metabolic 
      tissues; also, we provide information about how systemic metabolism or its 
      metabolites influence epigenetic modifications in the skeletal muscle.

TI  - Effect of Weekly Subcutaneous Semaglutide vs Daily Liraglutide on Body Weight in 
      Adults With Overweight or Obesity Without Diabetes: The STEP 8 Randomized Clinical 
      Trial.
PG  - 138-150
LID - 10.1001/jama.2021.23619 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Phase 3 trials have not compared semaglutide and liraglutide, 
      glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues available for weight management. OBJECTIVE: To 
      compare the efficacy and adverse event profiles of once-weekly subcutaneous 
      semaglutide, 2.4 mg, vs once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (both with diet 
      and physical activity), in people with overweight or obesity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: Randomized, open-label, 68-week, phase 3b trial conducted at 19 US 
      sites from September 2019 (enrollment: September 11-November 26) to May 2021 (end of 
      follow-up: May 11) in adults with body mass index of 30 or greater or 27 or greater 
      with 1 or more weight-related comorbidities, without diabetes (N = 338). 
      INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized (3:1:3:1) to receive once-weekly 
      subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg (16-week escalation; n = 126), or matching placebo, 
      or once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (4-week escalation; n = 127), or 
      matching placebo, plus diet and physical activity. Participants unable to tolerate 
      2.4 mg of semaglutide could receive 1.7 mg; participants unable to tolerate 3.0 mg 
      of liraglutide discontinued treatment and could restart the 4-week titration. 
      Placebo groups were pooled (n = 85). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end 
      point was percentage change in body weight, and confirmatory secondary end points 
      were achievement of 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more weight loss, assessed 
      for semaglutide vs liraglutide at week 68. Semaglutide vs liraglutide comparisons 
      were open-label, with active treatment groups double-blinded against matched placebo 
      groups. Comparisons of active treatments vs pooled placebo were supportive secondary 
      end points. RESULTS: Of 338 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 49 [13] years; 
      265 women [78.4%]; mean [SD] body weight, 104.5 [23.8] kg; mean [SD] body mass 
      index, 37.5 [6.8]), 319 (94.4%) completed the trial, and 271 (80.2%) completed 
      treatment. The mean weight change from baseline was -15.8% with semaglutide vs -6.4% 
      with liraglutide (difference, -9.4 percentage points [95% CI, -12.0 to -6.8]; 
      P < .001); weight change with pooled placebo was -1.9%. Participants had 
      significantly greater odds of achieving 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more 
      weight loss with semaglutide vs liraglutide (70.9% of participants vs 25.6% [odds 
      ratio, 6.3 {95% CI, 3.5 to 11.2}], 55.6% vs 12.0% [odds ratio, 7.9 {95% CI, 4.1 to 
      15.4}], and 38.5% vs 6.0% [odds ratio, 8.2 {95% CI, 3.5 to 19.1}], respectively; all 
      P < .001). Proportions of participants discontinuing treatment for any reason were 
      13.5% with semaglutide and 27.6% with liraglutide. Gastrointestinal adverse events 
      were reported by 84.1% with semaglutide and 82.7% with liraglutide. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: Among adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes, once-weekly 
      subcutaneous semaglutide compared with once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, added to 
      counseling for diet and physical activity, resulted in significantly greater weight 
      loss at 68 weeks. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04074161.

TI  - Effectiveness of nutrition interventions on improving diet quality and nutrition 
      knowledge in military populations: a systematic review.
LID - nuab087 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/nutrit/nuab087 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Optimizing nutrition in military groups through improved diet quality and 
      nutrition knowledge is key in supporting the high physical and cognitive demands. 
      OBJECTIVE: The objective of this investigation was to systematically review the 
      effectiveness of nutrition interventions among military personnel in improving diet 
      quality and/or nutrition knowledge. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and 
      Scopus were searched from the earliest records to May 2020. DATA EXTRACTION: Data 
      were extracted by 2 reviewers. The primary outcomes were diet quality and/or 
      nutrition knowledge. DATA ANALYSIS: Twenty studies were included. The main 
      intervention approaches identified were nutrition education of individuals (i.e., 
      education-based studies; EB) (n = 12), and manipulation of the food service 
      environment (i.e., dining facility studies; DFACs) (n = 8). The most common 
      strategies were face-to-face lectures (n = 8) for EB, and healthier menus (n = 7) 
      and education of catering staff (n = 6) for DFAC interventions. Most studies (18/20) 
      demonstrated favorable within-group effects; however, dietary changes were 
      inconsistent. Five of 10 studies using a comparator group demonstrated positive 
      between-group differences. CONCLUSION: Although potential exists for improving diet 
      quality and nutrition knowledge in military populations, the heterogeneity of the

TI  - Design and implementation of a standard care programme of therapeutic exercise and 
      education for breast cancer survivors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer survivors (BCS) face several symptoms and are at higher 
      risk of weight gain following diagnosis. Current literature shows that both exercise 
      and diet play a key role in recovery of BCS. However, there is a gap between current 
      guidelines and the real-world context. The aim of this article is to describe the 
      process behind a free, not-for-profit community-based therapeutic exercise and 
      education programme (TEEP) for BCS in the clinical setting. METHODS: The 
      "Onco-Health Club" (OHC) consists of therapeutic exercise (TE) intervention aimed at 
      ameliorating cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and improving QoL and physical function. 
      TE is supplemented with nutritional education, providing information about the 
      Mediterranean diet. To this end, patients are recruited from an oncologist and are 
      referred to a physiotherapist and a nutritionist for baseline assessment. TEEP 
      consists of a 3-month intervention, delivered twice a week in a group format with 
      1 h of TE and 30 min of nutritional education. BCS then have a final assessment and 
      are advised to continue with a healthy lifestyle. Data about referral, compliance 
      and assessment were collected. RESULTS: From May 2017 to February of 2020, a total 
      of 158 patients were recruited from 8 cohorts and 142 initially started the OHC. 
      From 119 that joined the program, 96 patients were considered to have finished it 
      with good adherence (assistance > 80%). BCS significantly improved their QoL, as 
      well as upper and lower limb's function, and increased their level of physical 
      activity. CRF tended to decrease (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: This study obtained data 
      on recruitment, compliance, and possible limitations of these kinds of programmes in 
      a real-world context. Further research is needed in order to optimize patient 
      engagement and compliance, as well as to determine the transferability of these 
      programmes in the clinical setting. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03879096, Registered 18th 
      March 2019. Retrospectively registered.

PG  - 8-24

AB  - Life participation requiring physical activity and physical function is a key 
      patient-reported outcome for people receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD). Clinician 
      guidance is required from multidisciplinary sources regarding exercise and activity 
      advice to address the specific needs of this group. From August 2020 through to June 
      2021, the Global Renal Exercise Network and the International Society for Peritoneal 
      Dialysis reviewed the published literature and international clinical experience to 
      develop a set of clinical practice points. A set of questions relevant to physical 
      activity and exercise were developed from the perspective of a person receiving PD 
      and were the basis for the practice point development. The GRADE framework was used 
      to evaluate the quality of evidence and to guide clinical practice points. The 
      review of the literature found sparse quality evidence, and thus the clinical 
      practice points are generally based on the expert consensus of people receiving PD, 
      PD exercise expert clinicians and experienced PD exercise researchers. Clinical 
      practice points address timing of exercise and activity (post-catheter insertion, 
      peritoneal space empty or full), the uptake of specific activities (work, sex, 
      swimming, core exercise), potential adverse outcomes related to activity and 
      exercise (exit site care, perspiration, cardiovascular compromise, fatigue, 
      intra-abdominal pressure), the effect of exercise and activity on conditions of 
      interest (mental health, obesity, frailty, low fitness) and exercise nutrition.

AB  - Aging results in loss of muscle mass and strength, which are linked to development 
      of metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. A number of studies have now shown that these effects can be ameliorated 
      by dietary supplementation with natural products such as vitamins, omega-3 fatty 
      acids, and protein and by physical activities such as aerobic and resistance 
      exercise. Here, we present a protocol for setting up a trial to test the effects of 
      vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and resistance exercise on various 
      anthropometric and molecular measurements in middle-aged females.

TI  - Effects of Community-based Exercise Prehabilitation for Patients Scheduled for 
      Colorectal Surgery With High Risk for Postoperative Complications: Results of a 
      Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - e299-e306
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000004702 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of a 3-week community-based exercise program on 
      30-day postoperative complications in high-risk patients scheduled for elective 
      colorectal resection for (pre)malignancy. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Patients with a 
      low preoperative aerobic fitness undergoing colorectal surgery have an increased 
      risk of postoperative complications. It remains, however, to be demonstrated whether 
      prehabilitation in these patients reduces postoperative complications. METHODS: This 
      2-center, prospective, single-blinded randomized clinical trial was carried out in 2 
      large teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients (≥60 years) with colorectal 
      (pre)malignancy scheduled for elective colorectal resection and with a score ≤7 
      metabolic equivalents on the veterans-specific activity questionnaire were randomly 
      assigned to the prehabilitation group or the usual care group by using 
      block-stratified randomization. An oxygen uptake at the ventilatory anaerobic 
      threshold <11 mL/kg/min at the baseline cardiopulmonary exercise test was the final 
      inclusion criterion. Inclusion was based on a power analysis. Patients in the 
      prehabilitation group participated in a personalized 3-week (3 sessions per week, 
      nine sessions in total) supervised exercise program given in community physical 
      therapy practices before colorectal resection. Patients in the reference group 
      received usual care. The primary outcome was the number of patients with one or more 
      complications within 30 days of surgery, graded according to the Clavien-Dindo 
      classification. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: Between 
      February 2014 and December 2018, 57 patients [30 males and 27 females; mean age 73.6 
      years (standard deviation 6.1), range 61-88 years] were randomized to either 
      prehabilitation (n = 28) or usual care (n = 29). The rate of postoperative 
      complications was lower in the prehabilitation group (n = 12, 42.9%) than in the 
      usual care group (n = 21, 72.4%, relative risk 0.59, 95% confidence interval 
      0.37-0.96, P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise prehabilitation reduced postoperative 
      complications in high-risk patients scheduled to undergo elective colon resection 
      for (pre)malignancy. Prehabilitation should be considered as usual care in high-risk 
      patients scheduled for elective colon, and probably also rectal, surgery.

TI  - Physical exercise at the crossroad between muscle wasting and the immune system: 
      implications for lung cancer cachexia.
PG  - 55-67
LID - 10.1002/jcsm.12900 [doi]
AB  - Cachexia is a syndrome characterized by involuntary weight loss and wasting of 
      skeletal muscle mass. It is associated with worse overall survival and quality of 
      life. The cancer-induced systemic inflammation and the consequent host derived 
      catabolic stimuli, trigger cachexia by inhibiting muscle protein synthesis and 
      enhancing muscle catabolism. The muscle itself may further promote chronic 
      inflammation, introducing a vicious catabolic circle. Nutritional support alone 
      plays a limited role in the treatment of cancer cachexia and should be combined with 
      other interventions. Physical exercise lowers systemic inflammation and promotes 
      muscle anabolism. It also attenuates the age-related physical decline in elderly and 
      it might counteract the muscle wasting induced by the cancer cachexia syndrome. This 
      review describes how cancer-induced systemic inflammation promotes muscle wasting 
      and whether physical exercise may represent a suitable treatment for cancer-induced 
      cachexia, particularly in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. We summarized 
      pre-clinical and clinical studies investigating whether physical exercise would 
      improve muscle performance and whether this improvement would translate in a 
      clinically meaningful benefit for patients with cancer, in terms of survival and 
      quality of life. Moreover, this review describes the results of studies 
      investigating the interplay between physical exercise and the immune system, 
      including the role of the intestinal microbiota.

TI  - Exponential Relationship Between Maximal Apnea Duration and Exercise Intensity in 
      Non-apnea Trained Individuals.
PG  - 815824
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2021.815824 [doi]
LID - 815824
AB  - It is well known that the duration of apnea is longer in static than in dynamic 
      conditions, but the impact of exercise intensity on the apnea duration needs to be 
      investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between apnea 
      duration and exercise intensity, and the associated metabolic parameters. Ten 
      healthy active young non-apnea trained (NAT) men participated in this study. During 
      the first visit, they carried out a maximum static apnea (SA) and a maximal 
      progressive cycle exercise to evaluate the power output achieved at peak oxygen 
      uptake (PVO(2)peak). During the second visit, they performed four randomized dynamic 
      apneas (DAs) at 20, 30, 40, and 50% of PVO(2)peak (P20, P30, P40, and P50) preceded 
      by 4 min of exercise without apnea. Duration of apnea, heart rate (HR), arterial 
      oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), blood lactate concentration [La], rating of perceived 
      exertion (RPE), and subjective feeling were recorded. Apnea duration was 
      significantly higher during SA (68.1 ± 23.6 s) compared with DA. Apnea duration at 
      P20 (35.6 ± 11.7 s) was higher compared with P30 (25.6 ± 6.3 s), P40 (19.2 ± 6.7 s), 
      and P50 (16.9 ± 2.5 s). The relationship between apnea duration and exercise 
      intensity followed an exponential function (y = 56.388e(-0.025) (x) ). SA as DA 
      performed at P20 and P30 induces a bradycardia. Apnea induces an SpO(2) decrease 
      which is higher during DA (-10%) compared with SA (-4.4%). The decreases of SPO(2) 
      recorded during DA do not differ despite the increase in exercise intensity. An 
      increase of [La] was observed in P30 and P40 conditions. RPE and subjective feeling 
      remained unchanged whatever the apnea conditions might be. These results suggest 
      that the DA performed at 30% of VO(2)peak could be the best compromise between apnea 
      duration and exercise intensity. Then, DA training at low intensity could be added 
      to aerobic training since, despite the moderate hypoxia, it is sufficient to induce 
      and increase [La] generally observed during high-intensity training.

TI  - Exercise Intolerance, Benefits, and Prescription for People Living With a Fontan 
      Circulation: The Fontan Fitness Intervention Trial (F-FIT)-Rationale and Design.
PG  - 799125
LID - 10.3389/fped.2021.799125 [doi]
LID - 799125
AB  - Background: Despite developments in surgical techniques and medical care, people 
      with a Fontan circulation still experience long-term complications; non-invasive 
      therapies to optimize the circulation have not been established. Exercise 
      intolerance affects the majority of the population and is associated with worse 
      prognosis. Historically, people living with a Fontan circulation were advised to 
      avoid physical activity, but a small number of heterogenous, predominantly 
      uncontrolled studies have shown that exercise training is safe-and for unique 
      reasons, may even be of heightened importance in the setting of Fontan physiology. 
      The mechanisms underlying improvements in aerobic exercise capacity and the effects 
      of exercise training on circulatory and end-organ function remain incompletely 
      understood. Furthermore, the optimal methods of exercise prescription are poorly 
      characterized. This highlights the need for large, well-designed, multi-center, 
      randomized, controlled trials. Aims and Methods: The Fontan Fitness Intervention 
      Trial (F-FIT)-a phase III clinical trial-aims to optimize exercise prescription and 
      delivery in people with a Fontan circulation. In this multi-center, randomized, 
      controlled study, eligible Fontan participants will be randomized to either a 
      4-month supervised aerobic and resistance exercise training program of 
      moderate-to-vigorous intensity followed by an 8-month maintenance phase; or usual 
      care (control group). Adolescent and adult (≥16 years) Fontan participants will be 
      randomized to either traditional face-to-face exercise training, telehealth exercise 
      training, or usual care in a three-arm trial with an allocation of 2:2:1 
      (traditional:telehealth:control). Children (<16 years) will be randomized to either 
      a physical activity and exercise program of moderate-to-vigorous intensity or usual 
      care in a two-arm trial with a 1:1 allocation. The primary outcome is a change in 
      aerobic exercise capacity (peak oxygen uptake) at 4-months. Secondary outcomes 
      include safety, and changes in cardiopulmonary exercise testing measures, peripheral 
      venous pressure, respiratory muscle and lung function, body composition, liver 
      stiffness, neuropsychological and neurocognitive function, physical activity levels, 
      dietary and nutritional status, vascular function, neurohormonal activation, 
      metabolites, cardiac function, quality of life, musculoskeletal fitness, and health 
      care utilization. Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, 4-months, and 
      12-months. This manuscript will describe the pathophysiology of exercise intolerance 
      in the Fontan circulation and the rationale and protocol for the F-FIT.

LID - 10.1007/s40279-021-01620-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Engaging in both resistance and endurance exercise within the same 
      training program, termed 'concurrent exercise training,' is common practice in many 
      athletic disciplines that require a combination of strength and endurance and is 
      recommended by a number of organizations to improve muscular and cardiovascular 
      health and reduce the risk of chronic metabolic disease. Dietary protein ingestion 
      supports skeletal muscle remodeling after exercise by stimulating the synthesis of 
      muscle proteins and can optimize resistance exercise-training mediated increases in 
      skeletal muscle size and strength; however, the effects of protein supplementation 
      on acute and longer-term adaptive responses to concurrent resistance and endurance 
      exercise are unclear. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this systematic review is to 
      evaluate the effects of dietary protein supplementation on acute changes in muscle 
      protein synthesis and longer-term changes in muscle mass, strength, and aerobic 
      capacity in responses to concurrent resistance and endurance exercise in healthy 
      adults. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in five databases: Scopus, 
      Embase, Medline, PubMed, and Web of Science. Acute and longer-term controlled trials 
      involving concurrent exercise and protein supplementation in healthy adults (ages 
      18-65 years) were included in this systematic review. Main outcomes of interest were 
      changes in skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates, muscle mass, muscle strength, 
      and whole-body aerobic capacity (i.e., maximal/peak aerobic capacity 
      [VO(2max/peak)]). The quality of studies was assessed using the National Institute 
      of Health Quality Assessment for Controlled Intervention Studies. RESULTS: Four 
      acute studies including 84 trained young males and ten longer-term studies including 
      167 trained and 391 untrained participants fulfilled the eligibility criteria. All 
      included acute studies demonstrated that protein ingestion enhanced myofibrillar 
      protein synthesis rates, but not mitochondrial protein synthesis rates during 
      post-exercise recovery after an acute bout of concurrent exercise. Of the included 
      longer-term training studies, five out of nine reported that protein supplementation 
      enhanced concurrent training-mediated increases in muscle mass, while five out of 
      nine studies reported that protein supplementation enhanced concurrent 
      training-mediated increases in muscle strength and/or power. In terms of aerobic 
      adaptations, all six included studies reported no effect of protein supplementation 
      on concurrent training-mediated increases in VO(2max/peak). CONCLUSION: Protein 
      ingestion after an acute bout of concurrent exercise further increases myofibrillar, 
      but not mitochondrial, protein synthesis rates during post-exercise recovery. There 
      is some evidence that protein supplementation during longer-term training further 
      enhances concurrent training-mediated increases in skeletal muscle mass and 
      strength/power, but not whole-body aerobic capacity (i.e., VO(2max/peak)).

TI  - Effects of oral cystine and glutamine on exercise-induced changes in 
      gastrointestinal permeability and damage markers in young men.

AB  - PURPOSE: Although acute prolonged strenuous exercise has been shown to increase 
      markers of gastrointestinal permeability and damage, little is known regarding the 
      efficacy of nutritional supplement interventions on the attenuation of 
      exercise-induced gastrointestinal syndrome. This study addressed the effects of oral 
      amino acid supplementation on markers of gastrointestinal permeability and damage in 
      response to exercise. METHODS: Sixteen active men aged 22.7 ± 2.6 years 
      (mean ± standard deviation) completed placebo or cystine and glutamine 
      supplementation trials in random order. Participants received either a placebo or 
      cystine and glutamine supplements, three times a day for 5 days, separated by a 
      2-week washout period. On day 6, participants took their designated supplements 
      30 min before running at a speed corresponding to 75% of maximal oxygen uptake for 
      1 h, followed by a 4-h rest period. Blood samples were collected pre-exercise, 
      immediately post-exercise, 30 min post-exercise, and 1, 2 and 4 h post-exercise on 
      day 6. The plasma lactulose to mannitol ratio (L:M) and plasma intestinal fatty 
      acid-binding protein (I-FABP) were used as markers of gastrointestinal permeability 
      and damage, respectively. RESULTS: Plasma L:M (linear mixed model, 
      coefficient ± standard error: - 0.011 ± 0.004, P = 0.0090) and changes (i.e., from 
      pre-exercise) in plasma I-FABP (linear mixed model, - 195.3 ± 65.7 
      coefficient ± standard error (pg/mL), P = 0.0035) were lower in the cystine and 
      glutamine supplementation trial than in the placebo trial. CONCLUSION: Oral cystine 
      and glutamine supplementation attenuated the markers of gastrointestinal 
      permeability and damage after 1 h of strenuous running in young men. TRIAL

TI  - Different Isocaloric Meals and Adiposity Modify Energy Expenditure, Clinical and 
      Metabolomic Biomarkers During Resting and Exercise States in a Randomized Cross-over 
      Acute Trial of Normal Weight and Overweight/obese Men.
LID - nxac006 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jn/nxac006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have assessed the integrative effects of diet, BMI, and 
      exercise on postprandial changes of energy and circulating metabolic profiles. 
      OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the collective effects of three isocaloric diets high 
      in carbohydrate (74.2% energy), fat (64.6% energy), or protein (39.5% energy) on 
      energy expenditure, clinical and metabolomic biomarkers under resting and exercise 
      conditions in normal-weight and overweight/obese men. METHODS: This cross-over 
      controlled acute trial included 20 normal-weight (BMI: 18.5- <24) and 20 
      overweight/obese (BMI ≥ 24 kg/m2) men aged 18-45 years. Each of three test meals was 
      provided for two continuous days: "Resting Day" without exercise, followed by 
      "Exercise Day" with a bicycling exercise of 50% maximal oxygen consumption 
      (postprandial 90-120 min). Energy expenditure (exploratory outcome of primary 
      interest) was measured using indirect calorimetry. Fasting and postprandial 2-hour 
      serum clinical and metabolomic biomarkers (secondary interest) were measured. Mixed 
      models were used to examine the effects of diet, time, and/or BMI category. RESULTS: 
      On Resting Day, no significant between-meal differences were detected for energy 
      expenditure. However, high-carbohydrate and high-fat meals induced the highest 
      postprandial 2-hour increase in glucose (0.34 ± 0.15 mmol/L) and triglyceride 
      (0.95 ± 0.09 mmol/L) respectively, while high-protein meal reduced glucose 
      (-0.48 ± 0.08 mmol/L) and total cholesterol (-0.01 ± 0.03 mmol/L, all Pdiet 
      < 0.001). On Exercise Day, high-carbohydrate diet significantly promoted 
      carbohydrate oxidation rate but suppressed fat oxidation rate (Pdiet < 0.05), while 
      its postprandial glucose response was attenuated by bicycling (-0.31 ± 0.03 mmol/L, 
      Pexercise < 0.001). 69 metabolites were identified as key features in discriminating 
      the three meals, and overweight/obese men had more varieties of metabolites than 
      normal-weight men. CONCLUSIONS: Three isocaloric meals induced unique postprandial 
      changes in clinical and metabolomic biomarkers, while exercise prevented 
      high-carbohydrate meal induced hyperglycemia. Overweight/obese men were more 
      responsive to the meal challenges than normal-weight men. This trial was registered 
      at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03231618.

AB  - Using metadata from previously published research, this investigation sought to 
      explore: (1) whole-body total carbohydrate and fat oxidation rates of endurance 
      (e.g., half and full marathon) and ultra-endurance runners during an incremental 
      exercise test to volitional exhaustion and steady-state exercise while consuming a 
      mixed macronutrient diet and consuming carbohydrate during steady-state running and 
      (2) feeding tolerance and glucose availability while consuming different 
      carbohydrate regimes during steady-state running. Competitively trained male 
      endurance and ultra-endurance runners (n = 28) consuming a balanced macronutrient 
      diet (57 ± 6% carbohydrate, 21 ± 16% protein, and 22 ± 9% fat) performed an 
      incremental exercise test to exhaustion and one of three 3 h steady-state running 
      protocols involving a carbohydrate feeding regime (76-90 g/h). Indirect calorimetry 
      was used to determine maximum fat oxidation (MFO) in the incremental exercise and 
      carbohydrate and fat oxidation rates during steady-state running. Gastrointestinal 
      symptoms (GIS), breath hydrogen (H(2)), and blood glucose responses were measured 
      throughout the steady-state running protocols. Despite high variability between 
      participants, high rates of MFO [mean (range): 0.66 (0.22-1.89) g/min], Fat(max) [63 
      (40-94) % V̇O(2max)], and Fat(min) [94 (77-100) % V̇O(2max)] were observed in the 
      majority of participants in response to the incremental exercise test to volitional 
      exhaustion. Whole-body total fat oxidation rate was 0.8 ± 0.3 g/min at the end of 
      steady-state exercise, with 43% of participants presenting rates of ≥1.0 g/min, 
      despite the state of hyperglycemia above resting homeostatic range [mean (95%CI): 
      6.9 (6.7-7.2) mmol/L]. In response to the carbohydrate feeding interventions of 
      90 g/h 2:1 glucose-fructose formulation, 38% of participants showed breath H(2) 
      responses indicative of carbohydrate malabsorption. Greater gastrointestinal symptom 
      severity and feeding intolerance was observed with higher carbohydrate intakes (90 
      vs. 76 g/h) during steady-state exercise and was greatest when high exercise 
      intensity was performed (i.e., performance test). Endurance and ultra-endurance 
      runners can attain relatively high rates of whole-body fat oxidation during exercise 
      in a post-prandial state and with carbohydrate provisions during exercise, despite 
      consuming a mixed macronutrient diet. Higher carbohydrate intake during exercise may 
      lead to greater gastrointestinal symptom severity and feeding intolerance.

AB  - Childbearing decreases HDL-cholesterol, potentially contributing to the increased 
      risk of CVD in parous women. Large HDL particles (HDL-P) are associated with lower 
      risk of CVD. In this secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial, we 
      investigated the effects of 12-week dietary and exercise treatments on HDL-P 
      subclass concentration, size and apoA1 in lactating women with overweight/obesity. 
      At 10-14 weeks postpartum, 68 women with pre-pregnant BMI 25-35 kg/m2 were 
      randomised to four groups using 2 × 2 factorial design: (1) dietary treatment for 
      weight loss; (2) exercise treatment; (3) both treatments and (4) no treatment. 
      Lipoprotein subclass profiling by NMR spectroscopy was performed in serum at 
      randomisation and after 3 and 12 months, and the results analysed with two-way 
      ANCOVA. Lipid concentrations decline naturally postpartum. At 3 months (5-6 months 
      postpartum), both diet (P = 0·003) and exercise (P = 0·008) reduced small HDL-P 
      concentration. Concurrently, exercise limited the decline in very large HDL-P (P = 
      0·002) and the effect was still significant at 12 months (15 months postpartum) (P = 
      0·041). At 12 months, diet limited the decline in very large HDL-P (P = 0·005), 
      large HDL-P (P = 0·001) and apoA1 (P = 0·002) as well as HDL size (P = 0·002). The 
      dietary treatment for weight loss and the exercise treatment both showed effects on 
      HDL-P subclasses in lactating women with overweight and obesity possibly associated 
      with lower CVD risk. The dietary treatment had more effects than the exercise 
      treatment at 12 months, likely associated with a 10 % weight loss.

AB  - Many studies address the effect of the COVID-19 restrictions on food consumption and 
      health, focusing on one or two measurements. Whether or not any effects are 
      permanent or change over a longer period of restrictions has not been assessed in 
      such studies. This study presented a survey containing questions on food 
      consumption, exercise and self-assessed physical and mental health, repeatedly for 
      six times over a 20-week period (July to November 2020) to a representative sample 
      of 258 Dutch consumers. The majority of consumers reported no change in food 
      consumption compared to before the COVID-19 restrictions, two smaller groups report 
      a change to a more, or a less, healthy choice. This trend appears stable over the 
      course of the measurements. The 'healthy changers' seem to couple a healthy and more 
      diverse diet to healthy exercise habits, in contrast to the 'unhealthy changers'. No 
      change was observed in self-assessed physical health over the measurements. Overall 
      a decline in time spent exercising showed, as well as a decline in self-assessed 
      mental health. Clearly a lockdown situation affects food choice, exercise habits and 
      (self-assessed) mental health. The fact that habits are able to suddenly change, for 
      better or for worse, and that a decrease in mental health was reported, suggests 
      that such insights need to be further explored to help individual consumers retain a 
      healthy diet and lifestyle, and governments devise effective public health 
      recommendations.

TI  - The Family Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey: Comparisons with Obesity and 
      Physical Activity in Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
LID - 10.1007/s10803-021-05415-9 [doi]
AB  - Adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at a heightened risk for 
      obesity. Family-level measures of nutrition and physical activity may help explain 
      factors contributing to disproportionate rates of weight gain. Twenty adolescents 
      with ASD participated in baseline testing for a study to assess the feasibility of 
      remotely-delivered yoga. Parents completed the Family Nutrition and Physical 
      Activity (FNPA) survey and anthropometrics and physical activity were assessed in 
      the adolescents. A median split was applied to the FNPA score to create high and low 
      obesogenic environments and nonparametric O'Brien's multiple endpoint tests were 
      used to evaluate the differences. Between-group differences were found in 
      anthropometrics (p = 0.01) but not physical activity (p = 0.72). Implications for a 
      multifaceted family-based approach to obesity prevention are discussed.

TI  - The acute effect of fasted exercise on energy intake, energy expenditure, subjective 
      hunger and gastrointestinal hormone release compared to fed exercise in healthy 
      individuals: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
PG  - 255-268
LID - 10.1038/s41366-021-00993-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the acute effect of fasted and fed exercise on energy 
      intake, energy expenditure, subjective hunger and gastrointestinal hormone release. 
      METHODS: CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science 
      databases were searched to identify randomised, crossover studies in healthy 
      individuals that compared the following interventions: (i) fasted exercise with a 
      standardised post-exercise meal [FastEx + Meal], (ii) fasted exercise without a 
      standardised post-exercise meal [FastEx + NoMeal], (iii) fed exercise with a 
      standardised post-exercise meal [FedEx + Meal], (iv) fed exercise without a 
      standardised post-exercise meal [FedEx + NoMeal]. Studies must have measured ad 
      libitum meal energy intake, within-lab energy intake, 24-h energy intake, energy 
      expenditure, subjective hunger, acyl-ghrelin, peptide YY, and/or glucagon-like 
      peptide 1. Random-effect network meta-analyses were performed for outcomes 
      containing ≥5 studies. RESULTS: 17 published articles (23 studies) were identified. 
      Ad libitum meal energy intake was significantly lower during FedEx + Meal compared 
      to FedEx + NoMeal (MD: -489 kJ; 95% CI, -898 to -80 kJ; P = 0.019). Within-lab 
      energy intake was significantly lower during FastEx + NoMeal compared to 
      FedEx + NoMeal (MD: -1326 kJ; 95% CI, -2102 to -550 kJ; P = 0.001). Similarly, 24-h 
      energy intake following FastEx + NoMeal was significantly lower than FedEx + NoMeal 
      (MD: -2095 kJ; 95% CI, -3910 kJ to -280 kJ; P = 0.024). Energy expenditure was 
      however significantly lower during FastEx + NoMeal compared to FedEx+NoMeal (MD: 
      -0.67 kJ/min; 95% CI, -1.10 to -0.23 kJ/min; P = 0.003). Subjective hunger was 
      significantly higher during FastEx + Meal (MD: 13 mm; 95% CI, 5-21 mm; P = 0.001) 
      and FastEx + NoMeal (MD: 23 mm; 95% CI, 16-30 mm; P < 0.001) compared to 
      FedEx + NoMeal. CONCLUSION: FastEx + NoMeal appears to be the most effective 
      strategy to produce a short-term decrease in energy intake, but also results in 
      increased hunger and lowered energy expenditure. Concerns regarding experimental 
      design however lower the confidence in these findings, necessitating future research 
      to rectify these issues when investigating exercise meal timing and energy balance. 
      PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020208041. KEY POINTS: Fed exercise with a 
      standardised post-exercise meal resulted in the lowest energy intake at the ad 
      libitum meal served following exercise completion. Fasted exercise without a 
      standardised post-exercise meal resulted in the lowest within-lab and 24-h energy 
      intake, but also produced the lowest energy expenditure and highest hunger. 
      Methodological issues lower the confidence in these findings and necessitate future 
      work to address identified problems.

AB  - Exercise activates a plethora of metabolic and signalling pathways in skeletal 
      muscle and other organs causing numerous systemic beneficial metabolic effects. 
      Thus, regular exercise may ameliorate and prevent the development of several chronic 
      metabolic diseases. Skeletal muscle is recognized as an important endocrine organ 
      regulating systemic adaptations to exercise. Skeletal muscle may mediate crosstalk 
      with other organs through the release of exercise-induced cytokines, peptides and 
      proteins, termed myokines, into the circulation. Importantly, other tissues such as 
      the liver and adipose tissue may also release cytokines and peptides in response to 
      exercise. Hence, exercise-released molecules are collectively called exerkines. 
      Moreover, extracellular vesicles (EVs), in the form of exosomes or microvesicles, 
      may carry some of the signals involved in tissue crosstalk. This review focuses on 
      the role of factors potentially mediating crosstalk between muscle and other tissues 
      in response to exercise.

AB  - While there is growing research interest in the effects of nutrition and exercise on 
      delaying sarcopenia, the results are inconclusive and there is scarce information on 
      regional patterns. This review evaluated the effects of the combination of protein 
      supplementation and exercise on muscle strength, mass and physical performance, 
      compared to exercise alone or with a placebo, in healthy older adults in Asian and 
      non-Asian countries. Fourteen studies were included in the analysis, involving a 
      total of 888 healthy older adults (>60 years). A significant increase in the 
      lower-extremity strength was observed in the combined intervention group compared to 
      the exercise group in Asian countries (SMD: 0.24, 95% CI [0.00, 0.47], p = 0.048, 
      I(2) = 0.0%). No statistical differences were found relating to upper-extremity 
      strength, muscle mass and physical performance. Protein supplementation combined

TI  - Multifactorial Mechanism of Sarcopenia and Sarcopenic Obesity. Role of Physical 
      Exercise, Microbiota and Myokines.
LID - 10.3390/cells11010160 [doi]
LID - 160
AB  - Obesity and ageing place a tremendous strain on the global healthcare system. 
      Age-related sarcopenia is characterized by decreased muscular strength, decreased 
      muscle quantity, quality, and decreased functional performance. Sarcopenic obesity 
      (SO) is a condition that combines sarcopenia and obesity and has a substantial 
      influence on the older adults' health. Because of the complicated pathophysiology, 
      there are disagreements and challenges in identifying and diagnosing SO. Recently, 
      it has become clear that dysbiosis may play a role in the onset and progression of 
      sarcopenia and SO. Skeletal muscle secretes myokines during contraction, which play 
      an important role in controlling muscle growth, function, and metabolic balance. 
      Myokine dysfunction can cause and aggravate obesity, sarcopenia, and SO. The only 
      ways to prevent and slow the progression of sarcopenia, particularly sarcopenic 
      obesity, are physical activity and correct nutritional support. While exercise 
      cannot completely prevent sarcopenia and age-related loss in muscular function, it 
      can certainly delay development and slow down the rate of sarcopenia. The purpose of 
      this review was to discuss potential pathways to muscle deterioration in obese 
      individuals. We also want to present the current understanding of the role of 
      various factors, including microbiota and myokines, in the process of sarcopenia and 
      SO.

TI  - Effects of Perch Essence Supplementation on Improving Exercise Performance and 
      Anti-Fatigue in Mice.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19031155 [doi]
LID - 1155
AB  - Silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) has many nutrition and health benefits, being a 
      rich source of macro and micronutrients, phospholipids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, 
      and a variety of essential minerals while having a high protein content. In addition 
      to direct consumption, it is often made into a soup as an important nutritional 
      supplement for strengthening the body and delaying fatigue. By extracting the 
      essence, its quality can be controlled, and it is convenient to supplement. This 
      study aimed to evaluate the effect of supplementation with Santé premium silver 
      perch essence (SPSPE) on improving exercise performance and anti-fatigue. Fifty male 
      institute of cancer research (ICR) mice were divided into five groups (n = 
      10/group): (1) vehicle (vehicle control or water only), (2) isocaloric (0.93 g 
      casein/kg/mice/day), (3) SPSPE-1X (0.99 g/kg/mice/day), (4) SPSPE-2X (1.98 
      g/kg/mice/day), and (5) SPSPE-5X (4.95 g/kg/mice/day). A sample or an equal volume 
      of liquid was fed orally for four consecutive weeks. Grip strength and swimming 
      exhaustion tests were used as exercise performance assessments. After 10 and 90 min 
      of unloaded swimming, biochemical parameters of fatigue were evaluated. We found 
      that supplementation with SPSPE for four consecutive weeks could significantly 
      improve mice's grip strength, exercise endurance performance, and glycogen content 
      (p < 0.05), and significantly reduced post-exercise fatigue biochemical parameters, 
      such as lactate, blood ammonia (NH(3)), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration, and 
      muscle damage index creatine kinase (CK) activity (p < 0.05). In summary, 
      supplementation with SPSPE for 4 weeks could effectively improve exercise 
      performance, reduce sports fatigue, and accelerate fatigue recovery. In addition, it 
      did not cause any physiological or histopathological damage.

TI  - Functional and structural adaptations of the coronary macro- and microvasculature to 
      regular aerobic exercise by activation of physiological, cellular, and molecular 
      mechanisms: ESC Working Group on Coronary Pathophysiology and Microcirculation 
      position paper.
PG  - 357-371
LID - 10.1093/cvr/cvab246 [doi]
AB  - Regular aerobic exercise (RAEX) elicits several positive adaptations in all organs 
      and tissues of the body, culminating in improved health and well-being. Indeed, in 
      over half a century, many studies have shown the benefit of RAEX on cardiovascular 
      outcome in terms of morbidity and mortality. RAEX elicits a wide range of functional 
      and structural adaptations in the heart and its coronary circulation, all of which 
      are to maintain optimal myocardial oxygen and nutritional supply during increased 
      demand. Although there is no evidence suggesting that oxidative metabolism is 
      limited by coronary blood flow (CBF) rate in the normal heart even during maximal 
      exercise, increased CBF and capillary exchange capacities have been reported. 
      Adaptations of coronary macro- and microvessels include outward remodelling of 
      epicardial coronary arteries, increased coronary arteriolar size and density, and 
      increased capillary surface area. In addition, there are adjustments in the neural 
      and endothelial regulation of coronary macrovascular tone. Similarly, there are 
      several adaptations at the level of microcirculation, including enhanced (such as 
      nitric oxide mediated) smooth muscle-dependent pressure-induced myogenic 
      constriction and upregulated endothelium-dependent/shear-stress-induced dilation, 
      increasing the range of diameter change. Alterations in the signalling interaction 
      between coronary vessels and cardiac metabolism have also been described. At the 
      molecular and cellular level, ion channels are key players in the local coronary 
      vascular adaptations to RAEX, with enhanced activation of influx of Ca2+ 
      contributing to the increased myogenic tone (via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels) as 
      well as the enhanced endothelium-dependent dilation (via TRPV4 channels). Finally, 
      RAEX elicits a number of beneficial effects on several haemorheological variables 
      that may further improve CBF and myocardial oxygen delivery and nutrient exchange in 
      the microcirculation by stabilizing and extending the range and further optimizing 
      the regulation of myocardial blood flow during exercise. These adaptations also act 
      to prevent and/or delay the development of coronary and cardiac diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Evidence suggests that multiple-behavior interventions (with a 
      specialist) have a greater impact on public health than single-behavior 
      interventions, particularly in a chronic patient. However, there is little 
      understanding of some very basic principles concerning multiple health behavior 
      change, especially in situations such as kidney transplantation, which requires a 
      great willingness to change negative lifestyle behaviors to achieve intermediate and 
      long-term success. We compared healthy lifestyles and nutritional status according 
      to the willingness to change dietary and exercise behavior in dialysis patients from 
      a living donor kidney transplant program. METHODS: 400 dialysis patients had a 
      dietetic, anthropometric, protein-energy wasting [subjective global assessment 
      (SGA)] and biochemical evaluation. Lifestyle was evaluated with an adapted 
      instrument to measure lifestyle in chronic disease. Willingness to change behaviors 
      was evaluated by the trans-theoretical model; 2 groups were formed: willingness to 
      change dietary and exercise behaviors and unwillingness to change. RESULTS: 
      Willingness to change dietary behavior was 50% and exercise 25%. Patients with 
      willingness to change dietary and exercise behaviors had better healthy lifestyle 
      scores, and higher frequency of healthy food consumption. Healthy lifestyle score 
      (R(2) = 0.37, p < 0.0001) was predicted by older age, higher educational degree, 
      shorter time on dialysis, and the highest willingness to change dietary and exercise 
      behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Willingness to change dietary and exercise behaviors was 
      associated with healthy lifestyle, as well as with higher frequency of healthy food 
      consumption and with lower frequency of unhealthy food consumption.

TI  - Comparing Video-Based, Telehealth-Delivered Exercise and Weight Loss Programs With 
      Online Education on Outcomes of Knee Osteoarthritis : A Randomized Trial.
PG  - 198-209
LID - 10.7326/M21-2388 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Scalable knee osteoarthritis programs are needed to deliver recommended 
      education, exercise, and weight loss interventions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate two 
      6-month, telehealth-delivered exercise programs, 1 with and 1 without dietary 
      intervention. DESIGN: 3-group, parallel randomized (5:5:2) trial. (Australian New 
      Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12618000930280). SETTING: Australian private 
      health insurance members. PARTICIPANTS: 415 persons with symptomatic knee 
      osteoarthritis and a body mass index between 28 and 40 kg/m(2) who were aged 45 to 
      80 years. INTERVENTION: All groups received access to electronic osteoarthritis 
      information (control). The exercise program comprised 6 physiotherapist 
      consultations via videoconference for exercise, self-management advice, and 
      behavioral counseling, plus exercise equipment and resources. The diet and exercise 
      program included an additional 6 dietitian consultations for a ketogenic 
      very-low-calorie diet (2 formulated meal replacements and a low-carbohydrate meal 
      daily) followed by a transition to healthy eating, as well as nutrition and 
      behavioral resources. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes were changes in knee pain 
      (numerical rating scale [NRS] of 0 to 10, higher indicating worse) and physical 
      function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC]; 
      scale, 0 to 68, higher indicating worse) at 6 months (primary time point) and 12 
      months. Secondary outcomes were weight, physical activity, quality of life, mental 
      health, global change, satisfaction, willingness to have surgery, orthopedic 
      appointments, and knee surgery. RESULTS: A total of 379 participants (91%) provided 
      6-month primary outcomes, and 372 (90%) provided 12-month primary outcomes. At 6 
      months, both programs were superior to control for pain (between-group mean 
      difference in change on NRS: diet and exercise, -1.5 [95% CI, -2.1 to -0.8]; 
      exercise, -0.8 [CI, -1.5 to -0.2]) and function (between-group mean difference in 
      change on WOMAC: diet and exercise, -9.8 [CI, -12.5 to -7.0]; exercise, -7.0 [CI, 
      -9.7 to -4.2]). The diet and exercise program was superior to exercise (pain, -0.6 
      [CI, -1.1 to -0.2]; function, -2.8 [CI, -4.7 to -0.8]). Findings were similar at 12 
      months. LIMITATION: Participants and clinicians were unblinded. CONCLUSION: 
      Telehealth-delivered exercise and diet programs improved pain and function in people 
      with knee osteoarthritis and overweight or obesity. A dietary intervention conferred 
      modest additional pain and function benefits over exercise. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE:

TI  - Changes in Cardiometabolic Risk Among Older Adults with Obesity: An Ancillary 
      Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial Investigating Exercise Plus Weight 
      Maintenance and Exercise Plus Intentional Weight Loss by Caloric Restriction.
PG  - 354-362

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity imposes risk to cardiometabolic health; however, intentional 
      weight loss among older adults with obesity remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To 
      explore the influence of exercise plus weight maintenance and exercise plus 
      intentional weight loss by caloric restriction on changes in cardiometabolic risk 
      among older adults with obesity assessed by four risk-scoring tools. DESIGN: Using 
      longitudinal data from the Calorie Restriction and Changes in Body Composition, 
      Disease, Function, and Quality of Life in Older Adults study (CROSSROADS) 
      (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00955903; May 2009 to October 2014), scores were 
      calculated using baseline and 12-month data according to criteria from the 
      International Diabetes Federation, National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult 
      Treatment Panel, Framingham Risk Score, and Cardiometabolic Disease Staging. 
      PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Participants (39% men, 23% African American, aged 70.2 ± 
      4.7 years) were randomized to exercise (n = 48), exercise plus nutrient-dense weight 
      maintenance diet (n = 44), or exercise plus weight loss by moderate caloric 
      restriction (n = 42). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To evaluate effects of exercise plus 
      weight maintenance and exercise plus intentional weight loss on changes in 
      cardiometabolic risk. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Generalized estimating 
      equations were used to assess changes in risk with ethnicity, biological sex, and 
      age as covariates. RESULTS: Group-time interaction was only significant for 
      Framingham and Cardiometabolic Disease Staging (P = 0.005 and 0.041, respectively). 
      Upon post hoc analysis, significant within-group improvements in Framingham scores 
      were observed for exercise plus weight maintenance (P < 0.001; r = -1.682) and 
      exercise plus weight loss (P = 0.020; r = -0.881). In analysis of between-group 
      differences in Framingham scores, significant decreases were observed in the 
      exercise plus weight maintenance group (P = 0.001; r = -1.723) compared with the 
      exercise group. For Cardiometabolic Disease Staging, the exercise plus weight loss 
      group had significant within-group improvements (P = 0.023; r = -0.102). For 
      between-group differences in Cardiometabolic Disease Staging, the exercise plus 
      weight loss group showed significant risk reduction (P = 0.012; r = -0.142) compared 
      with the exercise group. CONCLUSIONS: Among risk scores evaluated, Framingham and 
      Cardiometabolic Disease Staging showed significantly greater sensitivity to change 
      in cardiometabolic risk. Older adults with obesity can significantly lower 
      cardiometabolic risk through exercise plus weight maintenance or exercise plus 
      weight loss by moderate caloric restriction.

TI  - The Hydrating Effects of Hypertonic, Isotonic and Hypotonic Sports Drinks and Waters 
      on Central Hydration During Continuous Exercise: A Systematic Meta-Analysis and 
      Perspective.
PG  - 349-375
LID - 10.1007/s40279-021-01558-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Body-fluid loss during prolonged continuous exercise can impair 
      cardiovascular function, harming performance. Delta percent plasma volume (dPV) 
      represents the change in central and circulatory body-water volume and therefore 
      hydration during exercise; however, the effect of carbohydrate-electrolyte drinks 
      and water on the dPV response is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine by meta-analysis 
      the effects of ingested hypertonic (> 300 mOsmol kg(-1)), isotonic 
      (275-300 mOsmol kg(-1)) and hypotonic (< 275 mOsmol kg(-1)) drinks containing 
      carbohydrate and electrolyte ([Na(+)] < 50 mmol L(-1)), and non-carbohydrate 
      drinks/water (< 40 mOsmol kg(-1)) on dPV during continuous exercise. METHODS: A 
      systematic review produced 28 qualifying studies and 68 drink treatment effects. 
      Random-effects meta-analyses with repeated measures provided estimates of effects 
      and probability of superiority (p(+)) during 0-180 min of exercise, adjusted for 
      drink osmolality, ingestion rate, metabolic rate and a weakly informative Bayesian 
      prior. RESULTS: Mean drink effects on dPV were: hypertonic - 7.4% [90% compatibility 
      limits (CL) - 8.5, - 6.3], isotonic - 8.7% (90% CL - 10.1, - 7.4), hypotonic - 6.3% 
      (90% CL - 7.4, - 5.3) and water - 7.5% (90% CL - 8.5, - 6.4). Posterior contrast 
      estimates relative to the smallest important effect (dPV = 0.75%) were: 
      hypertonic-isotonic 1.2% (90% CL - 0.1, 2.6; p(+) = 0.74), hypotonic-isotonic 2.3% 
      (90% CL 1.1, 3.5; p(+) = 0.984), water-isotonic 1.3% (90% CL 0.0, 2.5; p(+) = 0.76), 
      hypotonic-hypertonic 1.1% (90% CL 0.1, 2.1; p(+) = 0.71), hypertonic-water 0.1% (90% 
      CL - 0.8, 1.0; p(+) = 0.12) and hypotonic-water 1.1% (90% CL 0.1, 2.0; p(+) = 0.72). 
      Thus, hypotonic drinks were very likely superior to isotonic and likely superior to 
      hypertonic and water. Metabolic rate, ingestion rate, carbohydrate characteristics 
      and electrolyte concentration were generally substantial modifiers of dPV. 
      CONCLUSION: Hypotonic carbohydrate-electrolyte drinks ingested continuously during 
      exercise provide the greatest benefit to hydration.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate distinct performance indicators and 
      energy system contributions in 3 different, new sport-specific finger flexor muscle 
      exercise tests. METHODS: The tests included the maximal strength test, the all-out 
      test (30 s) as well as the continuous and intermittent muscle endurance test at an 
      intensity equaling 60% of maximal force, which were performed until target force 
      could not be maintained. Gas exchange and blood lactate were measured in 13 
      experienced climbers during, as well as pre and post the test. The energy 
      contribution (anaerobic alactic, anaerobic lactic, and aerobic) was determined for 
      each test. RESULTS: The contribution of aerobic metabolism was highest during the 
      intermittent test (59.9 ± 12.0%). During continuous exercise, this was 28.1 ± 15.6%, 
      and in the all-out test, this was 19.4 ± 8.1%. The contribution of anaerobic alactic 
      energy was 27.2 ± 10.0% (intermittent), 54.2 ± 18.3% (continuous), and 62.4 ± 11.3% 
      (all-out), while anaerobic lactic contribution equaled 12.9 ± 6.4, 17.7 ± 8.9, and 
      18.2 ± 9.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The combined analysis of performance 
      predictors and metabolic profiles of the climbing test battery indicated that not 
      only maximal grip force, but also all-out isometric contractions are equally 
      decisive physical performance indices of climbing performance. Maximal grip force 
      reflects maximal anaerobic power, while all-out average force and force time 
      integral of constant isometric contraction at 60% of maximal force are functional 
      measures of anaerobic capacity. Aerobic energy demand for the intermittent exercise 
      is dominated aerobic re-phosphorylation of high-energy phosphates. The force-time 
      integral from the intermittent test was not decisive for climbing performance.

TI  - Evaluating Evidence-Based Content, Features of Exercise Instruction, and Expert 
      Involvement in Physical Activity Apps for Pregnant Women: Systematic Search and 
      Content Analysis.
PG  - e31607
LID - 10.2196/31607 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Guidelines for physical activity and exercise during pregnancy recommend 
      that all women without contraindications engage in regular physical activity to 
      improve both their own health and the health of their baby. Many women are uncertain 
      how to safely engage in physical activity and exercise during this life stage and 
      are increasingly using mobile apps to access health-related information. However, 
      the extent to which apps that provide physical activity and exercise advice align 
      with current evidence-based pregnancy recommendations is unclear. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study aims to conduct a systematic search and content analysis of apps that promote 
      physical activity and exercise in pregnancy to examine the alignment of the content 
      with current evidence-based recommendations; delivery, format, and features of 
      physical activity and exercise instruction; and credentials of the app developers. 
      METHODS: Systematic searches were conducted in the Australian App Store and Google 
      Play Store in October 2020. Apps were identified using combinations of search terms 
      relevant to pregnancy and exercise or physical activity and screened for inclusion 
      (with a primary focus on physical activity and exercise during pregnancy, free to 
      download or did not require immediate paid subscription, and an average user rating 
      of ≥4 out of 5). Apps were then independently reviewed using an author-designed 
      extraction tool. RESULTS: Overall, 27 apps were included in this review (Google Play 
      Store: 16/27, 59%, and App Store: 11/27, 41%). Two-thirds of the apps provided some 
      information relating to the frequency, intensity, time, and type principles of 
      exercise; only 11% (3/27) provided this information in line with current 
      evidence-based guidelines. Approximately one-third of the apps provided information 
      about contraindications to exercise during pregnancy and referenced the supporting 
      evidence. None of the apps actively engaged in screening for potential 
      contraindications. Only 15% (4/27) of the apps collected information about the 
      user's current exercise behaviors, 11% (3/27) allowed users to personalize features 
      relating to their exercise preferences, and a little more than one-third provided 
      information about developer credentials. CONCLUSIONS: Few exercise apps designed for 
      pregnancy aligned with current evidence-based physical activity guidelines. None of 
      the apps screened users for contraindications to physical activity and exercise 
      during pregnancy, and most lacked appropriate personalization features to account 
      for an individual's characteristics. Few involved qualified experts during the 
      development of the app. There is a need to improve the quality of apps that promote 
      exercise in pregnancy to ensure that women are appropriately supported to engage in 
      exercise and the potential risk of injury, complications, and adverse pregnancy 
      outcomes for both mother and child is minimized. This could be done by providing 
      expert guidance that aligns with current recommendations, introducing screening 
      measures and features that enable personalization and tailoring to individual users, 
      or by developing a recognized system for regulating apps.

      neuroinflammatory cytokine expression in female Wistar rats.
PG  - 317-326
LID - 10.1152/japplphysiol.00571.2021 [doi]
AB  - Neuroinflammation is an early detectable marker of mild cognitive impairment, the 
      transition state between normal cognition and dementia. Resistance-exercise training 
      can attenuate the cognitive decline observed in patients with mild cognitive 
      impairment. However, the underlying mechanisms of resistance training effects are 
      largely unknown. To further elucidate mechanisms of the known cognitive health 
      benefits from resistance-exercise training, we tested if resistance-exercise 
      training could ameliorate lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation. 
      Five-week-old female Wistar rats received intracerebroventricular injections of 
      lipopolysaccharides to induce neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. Rats then 
      underwent 3 wk of progressive ladder climbing to recapitulate resistance-exercise 
      training in humans. Cognition was assessed toward the end of the training period by 
      novelty object recognition testing. Neuroinflammation was measured one and 24 h 
      after the last resistance-exercise training workout. Resistance-exercise training 
      ameliorated cognitive impairment, diminished lipopolysaccharide-induced 
      neuroinflammatory cytokine expression, and attenuated astrocyte remodeling in the 
      dentate gyrus 24 h post exercise. Here, we provide evidence that the ladder-climbing 
      model of resistance-exercise training in rats can improve cognition as early as 3 
      wk. In addition, these data support the hypothesis that resistance exercise can 
      reduce lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation in the dentate gyrus.NEW & 
      NOTEWORTHY To further elucidate the known cognitive health benefits from 
      resistance-exercise training, we tested if resistance-exercise training in rats 
      would attenuate lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammation. Our data demonstrated 
      that resistance training had an anti-inflammatory effect in the brain as LPS-induced 
      neuroinflammatory cytokine expression and reactive astrocytic remodeling were 
      reduced in the dentate gyrus after 3 wk of progressive ladder climbing.

TI  - Family Child Care Home Providers' Self-Reported Nutrition and Physical Activity 
      Practices, Self-Efficacy, Barriers, and Knowledge: Baseline Findings from Happy

PG  - 1-38
LID - 10.1017/S1368980022000337 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Describe nutrition and physical activity practices, nutrition 
      self-efficacy and barriers, and food program knowledge within Family Child Care 
      Homes (FCCH), and differences by staffing. DESIGN: Baseline, cross-sectional 
      analyses of the Happy Healthy Homes randomized trial (NCT03560050). SETTING: FCCH in 
      Oklahoma, United States. PARTICIPANTS: FCCH providers (n=49, 100% women, 30.6% 
      Non-Hispanic Black, 2.0% Hispanic, 4.1% American Indian/Alaska Native, 51.0% 
      Non-Hispanic white, 44.2±14.2 years of age. 53.1% had additional staff) 
      self-reported nutrition and physical activity practices and policies, nutrition 
      self-efficacy and barriers, and food program knowledge. Differences between 
      providers with and without additional staff were adjusted for multiple comparisons 
      (p<0.01). RESULTS: The prevalence of meeting all nutrition and physical activity 
      best practices ranged from 0.0-43.8% and 4.1-16.7%, respectively. Average nutrition 
      and physical activity scores were 3.2±0.3 and 3.0±0.5 (max 4.0), respectively. Sum 
      nutrition and physical activity scores were 137.5±12.6 (max 172.0) and 48.4±7.5 (max 
      64.0), respectively. Providers reported high nutrition self-efficacy and few 
      barriers. The majority of providers (73.9-84.7%) felt they could meet food program 
      best practices; however, knowledge of food program best practices was lower than 
      anticipated (median 63-67% accuracy). More providers with additional staff had 
      higher self-efficacy in family style meal service than did those who did not 
      (p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Providers had high self-efficacy in meeting nutrition best 
      practices and reported few barriers. While providers were successfully meeting some 
      individual best practices, few met all. Few differences were observed between FCCH 
      providers with and without additional staff. FCCH providers need additional 
      nutrition training on implementation of best practices.

TI  - Acute and chronic effects of high-intensity interval and moderate-intensity 
      continuous exercise on heart rate and its variability after recent myocardial 
      infarction: A randomized controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Resting heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV) are known to predict 
      mortality in patients after myocardial infarction (MI). OBJECTIVE: We assessed acute 
      and chronic effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) versus 
      moderate-intensity continuous exercise (MICE) on HR and HRV in individuals after 
      acute ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI). METHODS: Participants within 7 weeks after MI 
      were randomly assigned to HIIT or MICE groups for a 9-week intervention. HR and the 
      power spectrum of HRV were measured pre- and post-intervention by using orthostatic 
      challenge and during sleep to assess chronic effects. Sleep measurements were 
      performed at night after HIIT, MICE or no training to assess acute effects. Mixed 
      models assessed time*group interaction for differences in chronic and acute effects, 
      adjusted for beta-blocker dose and number of training sessions. RESULTS: Overall, 34 
      of 37 and 35 of 36 participants in the HIIT and MICE groups completed the study. We 
      found a trend for an acute increase in HR of 2.5 bpm (4%, P=0.023) during sleep 
      after HIIT. We found a trend for a chronic decrease in HR during supine and standing 
      position as well as during sleep in the MICE group but a trend for an increase in HR 
      during supine and standing position in the HIIT group. Low- and high-frequency power 
      (LF, HF) of the standing segment increased from pre- to post-intervention in the 
      MICE group but decreased in the HIIT group (group*time interaction P=0.005 and 
      P=0.026, respectively). CONCLUSION: HR during sleep tended to be increased acutely 
      during the night after HIIT but not after MICE as compared with controls. Chronic 
      effects on resting HR, HF and LF tended to be more beneficial after MICE than HIIT 
      in individuals with recent STEMI.

AB  - Overweight and obese men with prostate cancer are at an increased risk of disease 
      recurrence, exacerbated treatment-related adverse effects, development of 
      obesity-related comorbidities, earlier progression and development of metastatic 
      disease, and higher all-cause and prostate cancer-specific mortality. The 
      physiological mechanisms associating obesity with poor prostate cancer outcomes 
      remain largely unknown; however, an increased inflammatory environment and metabolic 
      irregularities associated with excess fat mass are commonly postulated. Although 
      research is limited, fat loss strategies using exercise and nutrition programmes may 
      slow down prostate cancer progression and improve a patient's prognosis. This review 
      is an overview of: 1) the association between obesity and poor prostate cancer 
      prognosis; 2) potential physiological mechanisms linking obesity and prostate cancer 
      progression; 3) the effect of obesity on treatments for prostate cancer; and 4) the 
      potential for weight loss strategies to improve outcomes in patients with prostate 
      cancer.

TI  - Effect of acute dietary- versus combined dietary and exercise-induced energy 
      deficits on subsequent energy intake, appetite and food reward in adolescents with 
      obesity.

LID - S0031-9384(21)00337-1 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute dietary-induced energy deficits have been shown to favor 
      compensatory appetitive responses. The aim of this study was to compare energy 
      intake (EI), appetite sensations and the hedonic responses to equivalent energy 
      deficits induced by dietary restriction alone and combined with exercise in 
      adolescents with obesity. METHODS: In a within-subjects design, seventeen 
      adolescents with obesity (12-16 years, Tanner stage 3-5, 6 males) randomly completed 
      three 14 h conditions: (i) control (CON); (ii) deficit induced by diet only (Def-EI) 
      and; (iii) deficit induced by combined diet and physical exercise (Def-mixed). 
      Breakfast and lunch were calibrated to generate a 500 kcal deficit in Def-EI and 
      250 kcal deficit in Def-mixed. A 250 kcal deficit was created through a cycling 
      exercise set at 65% VO(2peak) in Def-mixed. Ad libitum EI, macronutrients and 
      relative EI (REI) were assessed at dinner, subjective appetite sensations taken at 
      regular intervals, and food reward measured before dinner. RESULTS: EI at dinner was 
      significantly lower in Def-EI compared to CON (p = 0.014; Effect size (ES): -0.59 
      [-1.07; -0.12]), with no difference between Def-mixed and both CON and Def-EI. Total 
      REI was lower in both deficit conditions compared with CON (Def-mixed: p < 0.001; 
      ES: -3.80 [-4.27; -3.32], Def-EI: p < 0.001; ES: -4.90 [-5.37; -4.42] respectively), 
      indicating incomplete compensation for the energy deficits. Absolute protein 
      ingestion at dinner was lower in Def-EI than Def-mixed (p = 0.037; ES: -0.50 [-0.98; 
      -0.03]) and absolute lipid ingestion was lower in Def-EI than in CON (p = 0.033; ES: 
      -0.51 [-0.99; -0.04]). A higher proportion of protein and a lower proportion of 
      carbohydrates was observed in Def-mixed than in Def-EI (p = 0.078; ES: -0.42 [-0.90; 
      0.04] and p = 0.067; ES: 0.44 [-0.03; 0.92] respectively). Total area under the 
      curve for appetite sensations were similar between conditions. Explicit liking for 
      sweet relative to savoury food was lower in Def-mixed compared to CON (p = 0.027; 
      ES: -0.53 [-1.01; -0.06]) with no difference in food reward between Def-EI and CON. 
      CONCLUSION: Neither of the two acute isoenergetic deficits led to subsequent 
      appetitive compensation, with the dietary deficit even inducing a lower ad libitum 
      EI at the subsequent dinner. Further studies are needed to better understand the 
      appetitive response to dietary and exercise energy balance manipulations in this 
      population.

TI  - Classic and exertional heatstroke.
PG  - 8

AB  - In the past two decades, record-breaking heatwaves have caused an increasing number 
      of heat-related deaths, including heatstroke, globally. Heatstroke is a heat illness 
      characterized by the rapid rise of core body temperature above 40 °C and central 
      nervous system dysfunction. It is categorized as classic when it results from 
      passive exposure to extreme environmental heat and as exertional when it develops 
      during strenuous exercise. Classic heatstroke occurs in epidemic form and 
      contributes to 9-37% of heat-related fatalities during heatwaves. Exertional 
      heatstroke sporadically affects predominantly young and healthy individuals. Under 
      intensive care, mortality reaches 26.5% and 63.2% in exertional and classic 
      heatstroke, respectively. Pathological studies disclose endothelial cell injury, 
      inflammation, widespread thrombosis and bleeding in most organs. Survivors of 
      heatstroke may experience long-term neurological and cardiovascular complications 
      with a persistent risk of death. No specific therapy other than rapid cooling is 
      available. Physiological and morphological factors contribute to the susceptibility 
      to heatstroke. Future research should identify genetic factors that further describe 
      individual heat illness risk and form the basis of precision-based public health 
      response. Prioritizing research towards fundamental mechanism and diagnostic 
      biomarker discovery is crucial for the design of specific management approaches.

TI  - Tetrahydrobiopterin Administration Augments Exercise-Induced Hyperemia and 
      Endothelial Function in Patients With Systemic Sclerosis.

AB  - Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare, auto-immune disease with variably progressive 
      fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, as well as vascular dysfunction. Recently, 
      we demonstrated a decrement in exercising skeletal muscle blood flow and 
      endothelium-dependent vasodilation in SSc, but the mechanisms responsible for these 
      impairments have not been investigated. Thus, we sought to determine if acute 
      administration of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4)), an essential cofactor for endothelial 
      nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), would improve hyperemia and brachial artery 
      vasodilation during progressive handgrip exercise in SSc. Thirteen patients with SSc 
      (63 ± 11 years) participated in this placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, 
      crossover study. Tetrahydrobiopterin (10 mg/kg) administration resulted in a ~4-fold 
      increase in circulating BH(4) concentrations (P < 0.05). Cardiovascular variables at 
      rest were unaffected by BH(4) (P > 0.05). During handgrip exercise, BH(4) 
      administration increased brachial artery blood flow (placebo: 200 ± 87; BH(4): 261 ± 
      115 ml/min; P < 0.05) and vascular conductance (placebo: 2.0 ± 0.8; BH(4): 2.5 ± 1.0 
      ml/min/mmHg; P < 0.05), indicating augmented resistance artery vasodilation. 
      Tetrahydrobiopterin administration also increased brachial artery vasodilation in 
      response to exercise (placebo: 12 ± 6; BH(4): 17 ± 7%; P < 0.05), resulting in a 
      significant upward shift in the slope relationship between Δ brachial artery 
      vasodilation and Δ shear rate (placebo: 0.030 ± 0.007; BH(4): 0.047 ± 0.007; P < 
      0.05) that indicates augmented sensitivity of the brachial artery to vasodilate to 
      the sustained elevations in shear rate during handgrip exercise. These results 
      demonstrate the efficacy of acute BH(4) administration to improve both resistance 
      and conduit vessel endothelial function in SSc, suggesting that eNOS recoupling may 
      be an effective strategy for improving vasodilatory capacity in this patient group.

AB  - Sarcopenia - the age-associated loss of muscle function and muscle mass - is of 
      utmost importance for older patients with degenerative and traumatic diseases of the 
      musculoskeletal system, as it closely linked to the loss of independence and quality 
      of life in higher age. Impairments of mobility that are highly present in this 
      patient group accelerate the age-associated decline of muscle function and muscle 
      mass. The diagnosis of sarcopenia relies primarily on tests of strength and function 
      like handgrip, chair-rise test and gait speed. The measurement of muscle mass is 
      desirable, but not mandatory. In the near future the prevention and treatment of 
      sarcopenia has to become part of the clinical routine for older orthopedic patients. 
      Specific modifications of physical exercise like resistance training and optimal 
      nutrition with regard to protein intake (1.0-1.2 g/kg bodyweight per day) in 
      combination with vitamin D supplementation are key components of sarcopenia 
      prevention and therapy.

TI  - Head, Face and Neck Cooling as Per-cooling (Cooling During Exercise) Modalities to 
      Improve Exercise Performance in the Heat: A Narrative Review and Practical 
      Applications.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1186/s40798-022-00411-4 [doi]

AB  - It is well known that uncompensable heat stress greatly impairs endurance and team 
      sport-related performance because an increase in the core temperature directly 
      induces a greater magnitude of the central fatigue in the heat than in thermal 
      neutral environments. Numerous studies have been conducted in an attempt to discover 
      reliable cooling strategies for improving endurance performance and repeated sprint 
      ability while exercising in the heat. Whole-body pre-cooling has been shown to 
      improve endurance performance in both dry and humid heat. Despite this, the 
      reduction in thermal perceptions associated with pre-cooling gradually narrows 
      during intense exercise. Hence, effective per-cooling strategies to improve athletic 
      performance in the heat are required. Unfortunately, due to practical issues, 
      adopting pre-cooling approaches as a per-cooling (cooling during exercise) modality 
      to improve athletic performance is impractical. Thus, we sought to examine the 
      impact of head, neck and face cooling on athletic performance in heat. According to 
      current evidence, cooling the head, neck and face reduced local skin temperature in 
      the areas where cooling was applied, resulting in improved local perceptual 
      sensations. In the heat, neck cooling during exercise improves athletic performance 
      in both endurance and team sports athletes. Furthermore, from a practical 
      standpoint, neck cooling is preferred over head, face and combined head/face and 
      neck cooling for both endurance and team sport athletes in the heat. Nonetheless, 
      for all athletes who have access to water, face cooling is a recommended cooling 
      strategy. There is a lack of research on the systematic selection of per-cooling 
      modalities to improve athletic performance based on environmental conditions and the 
      nature of sports. In addition, powerful but portable head, neck and face cooling 
      systems are urgently needed to assist athletes in improving their performance in hot 
      conditions.

AB  - Poor nutrition, lack of exercise, and genetic predisposition all contribute to the 
      growing epidemic of obesity. Overweight/obesity create an environment of chronic 
      inflammation that leads to negative physiological and neurological outcomes, such as 
      diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and anxiety/depression. While the whole body 
      contributes to metabolic homeostasis, the neuroimmune system has recently emerged as 
      a key regulator of metabolism. Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, 
      respond both directly and indirectly to dietary fat, and the environment in which 
      microglia develop contributes to their responsiveness later in life. Thus, high 
      maternal weight during pregnancy may have consequences for microglial function in 
      offspring. Here, we discuss the most recent findings on microglia signaling in 
      overweight/obesity with a focus on perinatal programming.

TI  - Cardiovascular responses to dynamic and static upper-body exercise in a cold 
      environment in coronary artery disease patients.
PG  - 223-232
LID - 10.1007/s00421-021-04826-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Upper-body exercise performed in a cold environment may increase 
      cardiovascular strain, which could be detrimental to patients with coronary artery 
      disease (CAD). This study compared cardiovascular responses of CAD patients during 
      graded upper-body dynamic and static exercise in cold and neutral environments. 
      METHODS: 20 patients with stable CAD performed 30 min of progressive dynamic (light, 
      moderate, and heavy rating of perceived exertion) and static (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30% 
      of maximal voluntary contraction) upper body exercise in cold (- 15 °C) and neutral 
      (+ 22 °C) environments. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and 
      electrocardiographic (ECG) responses were recorded and rate pressure product (RPP) 
      calculated. RESULTS: Dynamic-graded upper-body exercise in the cold increased HR by 
      2.3-4.8% (p = 0.002-0.040), MAP by 3.9-5.9% (p = 0.038-0.454) and RPP by 18.1-24.4% 
      (p = 0.002-0.020) when compared to the neutral environment. Static graded upper-body 
      exercise in the cold resulted in higher MAP (6.3-9.1%; p = 0.000-0.014), lower HR 
      (4.1-7.2%; p = 0.009-0.033), but unaltered RPP compared to a neutral environment. 
      Heavy dynamic exercise resulted in ST depression that was not related to 
      temperature. Otherwise, ECG was largely unaltered during exercise in either thermal 
      condition. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic- and static-graded upper-body exercise in the cold 
      involves higher cardiovascular strain compared with a neutral environment among 
      patients with stable CAD. However, no marked changes in electric cardiac function 
      were observed. The results support the use of upper-body exercise in the cold in 
      patients with stable CAD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trial registration 
      NCT02855905 August 2016.

TI  - Competency-based assessment in nutrition education: A systematic literature review.
PG  - 102-111
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12946 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A suitably prepared and qualified nutrition and dietetics workforce is 
      part of the solution to combating the burden of disease. Competency-based assessment 
      is a key part of the education of future workforces. Although there has been recent 
      attention on competency-based assessment in dietetics, there is little exploration 
      of competency-based education for the preparation of nutritionists. The present 
      study aimed to understand how competency-based assessment is implemented and 
      evaluated in nutrition education. METHODS: A systematic literature review was 
      carried out according to PRISMA guidelines. Four databases were initially searched 
      in February 2020 using key words related to competenc* in combination with nutrition 
      or dietetic and their synonyms. An updated search was completed again in March 2021. 
      Studies that met eligibility criteria where the focus was on nutrition and involved 
      a method of competency-based assessment were synthesised narratively. RESULTS: From 
      a total of 6262 titles and abstracts, six studies on competency assessment in 
      nutrition education were identified. The assessments focused on the development of 
      key skills, including motivational interviewing and nutrition assessment, changes to 
      knowledge and attitudes on food and culture, and self-perceived development of 
      communication, collaboration, management, advocacy, scholarship and professional 
      capabilities. No studies were found that assessed promotion of health and wellbeing 
      or the food chain competencies. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of research in 
      competency-based assessment must be addressed to ensure we are effectively preparing 
      future nutritionists for work such that they can impact health outcomes.

TI  - A systematic scoping review of the literacy literature to develop a digital food and 
      nutrition literacy model for low-income adults to make healthy choices in the online 
      food retail ecosystem to reduce obesity risk.
LID - 10.1111/obr.13414 [doi]
AB  - Adults with lower incomes are disproportionately affected by poverty, food 
      insecurity, obesity, and diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs). In 2020-2021 
      amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the United States Department 
      of Agriculture (USDA) expanded the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) 
      Online Purchasing Pilot program to enable eligible participants to purchase 
      groceries online in 47 states. This expansion underscores the need for SNAP adults 
      to have digital literacy skills to make healthy dietary choices online. Currently, a 
      digital literacy model does not exist to help guide USDA nutrition assistance 
      policies and programs, such as SNAP. We conducted a systematic scoping review of the 
      academic and gray literature to identify food, nutrition, health, media, financial, 
      and digital literacy models. The search yielded 40 literacy models and frameworks 
      that we analyzed to develop a Multi-dimensional Digital Food and Nutrition Literacy 
      (MDFNL) model with five literacy levels (i.e., functional, interactive, 
      communicative, critical, and translational) and a cross-cutting digital literacy 
      component. Utilization of the MDFNL model within nutrition assistance policies and 
      programs may improve cognitive, behavioral, food security, and health outcomes and 
      support equity, well-being, digital inclusion, and healthy communities to reduce 
      obesity and NCD risks.

TI  - Impact of Cancer Cachexia on Cardiac and Skeletal Muscle: Role of Exercise Training.
LID - 10.3390/cancers14020342 [doi]
LID - 342
AB  - Cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome that presents with, among other 
      characteristics, progressive loss of muscle mass and anti-cardiac remodeling effect 
      that may lead to heart failure. This condition affects about 80% of patients with 
      advanced cancer and contributes to worsening patients' tolerance to anticancer 
      treatments and to their premature death. Its pathogenesis involves an imbalance in 
      metabolic homeostasis, with increased catabolism and inflammatory cytokines levels, 
      leading to proteolysis and lipolysis, with insufficient food intake. A multimodal 
      approach is indicated for patients with cachexia, with the aim of reducing the speed 
      of muscle wasting and improving their quality of life, which may include 
      nutritional, physical, pharmacologic, and psychological support. This review aims to 
      outline the mechanisms of muscle loss, as well as to evaluate the current clinical 
      evidence of the use of physical exercise in patients with cachexia.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of a Pender's health 
      promotion model-based Physical Activity and Healthy Nutrition Program for University 
      Students (UNI-PAHNP) as a means for improving university students' nutrition and 
      physical activity behaviors. METHOD: A total of 110 overweight and obese students 
      were randomized into study and control groups. FINDINGS: Students in the 
      intervention group showed significant decreases in body mass index and waist 
      circumference and significant increases in step count, physical activity, nutrition 
      and exercise scores, vegetable and water intake frequency, and self-efficacy to 
      regulate nutrition and exercise from pre-intervention to six months 
      post-intervention (p < 0.05). PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: This study shows the value of 
      utilizing nurses to implement a health promotion program for overweight/obese 
      university students.

TI  - What are the benefits and risks of nutrition policy actions to reduce added sugar 
      consumption? An Australian case study.
PG  - 1-18
LID - 10.1017/S1368980022000234 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to critically analyse Australia's current and proposed 
      policy actions to reduce added sugar consumption. Over-consumption of added sugar is 
      a significant public health nutrition issue. The competing interests, values and 
      beliefs among stakeholders mean they have disparate views regarding which policy 
      actions are preferable to reduce added sugar consumption. DESIGN: Semi-structured 
      interviews using purposive, snowball sampling and policy mapping. Policy actions 
      were classified by two frameworks: NOURISHING (e.g. behaviour change communication, 
      food environment and food system) and the Orders of Change (e.g. first order: 
      technical adjustments, second order: reforming the system, third order: transforming 
      the system). SETTING: Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two stakeholders from the food 
      industry, food regulation, government, public health groups and academia. RESULTS: 
      All proposed and existing policy actions targeted the food environment/behaviour 
      change; most were assessed as first-order changes, and reductionist (nutrient 
      specific) in nature. Influences on policy actions included industry power, 
      stakeholder fragmentation, government ideology/political will and public pressure. 
      Few stakeholders considered potential risks of policy actions, particularly of 
      non-nutritive sweetener substitution or opportunity costs for other policies. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Most of Australia's policy actions to reduce added sugar consumption 
      are reductionist. Preferencing nutrient specific, first-order policy actions could 
      reflect the influence of vested interests, a historically dominant reductionist 
      orientation to nutrition science and policy, and the perceived difficulty of 
      pursuing second- or third-order changes. Pursuing only first-order policy actions 
      could lead to 'regrettable' substitutions and creates an opportunity cost for more 
      comprehensive policy aimed at adjusting the broader food system.

TI  - The effects of metformin, pioglitazone, exenatide and exercise on fatty liver in 
      obese diabetic rats: the role of IRS-1 and SOCS-3 molecules.
LID - 10.1007/s10787-021-00916-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity-induced inflammation mechanism is seen as a mechanism that may 
      be the cause of insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). 
      Pathological destruction of insulin signaling molecules such as insulin receptor 
      substrate proteins (IRS), especially due to the increase of cytokine signal 
      suppressors (SOCS), has been demonstrated in experimental diabetes. The aim of this 
      study was to determine the effects of metformin, pioglitazone, exenatide and 
      exercise treatments used in type 2 diabetes on fatty liver and the role of Irs-1 and 
      Socs3 molecules in this process in obese diabetic rats. METHODS: The study was 
      conducted on 48 Wistar albino adult male rats weighing 180-220 g and randomly 
      divided into 6 groups. The obese rat model with fatty liver was formed with a 60% 
      fat diet for 4 weeks. Afterwards, drug treatment with metformin (Ob + D + M), 
      pioglitazone (Ob + D + P), exenatide (Ob + D + ExA)) or exercise (Ob + D + ExE) was 
      applied for 4 weeks to these obese groups, in which diabetes was induced by 
      streptozocin (STZ). At the end of the experimental protocol, liver tissue samples 
      were taken from all rat groups and histopathological and genetic analyses were 
      performed. RESULTS: The mean steatosis degrees of the Ob + D + ExA and Ob + D + ExE 
      groups were statistically significantly decreased compared to the obese diabetic 
      group (p < 0.001). The group with the lowest mean steatosis grade was the 
      Ob + D + ExE. Decrease in SOCS-3 expression was significant in Ob + D + M and 
      Ob + D + P groups than other groups (p < 0.05). Mean staining intensities of 
      Ob + D + Ex group, Ob + D + ExE group and Ob + D + P group according to IRS-1 
      expression statistically significantly increased compared to obese diabetic group 
      (p < 0.05). Average staining intensity of Ob + D + ExE group according to IRS-1 
      expression was significant than other groups. CONCLUSION: Exercise and exenatide 
      treatments seemed to be the prominent treatment methods by showing a statistically 
      significant effect in decreasing the degree of steatosis, decreasing the Socs3 
      expression level and increasing the Irs-1 expression level.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study examined the effect of a personal trainer's sex on 
      self-efficacy and fitness in woman clients. METHODS: Women (N.=28; mean age, 
      41.6±15.0 years; height, 153.49±28.11 cm; BMI, 25.9±6.4 kg/m(2)) completed a 
      perceptual scale of self-efficacy (BARSE) and fitness tests before and after a 
      training program. Trainers (men and women) met one-on-one with the volunteers on a 
      biweekly basis for 8 weeks. Univariate analyses of change scores and repeated 
      measures analysis of variance with Fisher's LSD pairwise comparisons tested changes 
      in dependent variables by trainer sex. RESULTS: Significant increases were seen in 
      (mean±SE; change for men trainers; change for woman trainers): self-efficacy 
      (7.3±3.4; 7.3±2.7%); leg press strength (18.2±3.7; 16.4±3.3 kg); seated row 
      (6.1±1.5; 5.3±1.3 kg); muscular endurance in 60° flexion hold (20.5±5.8; 24.8±5.0 s) 
      and wall-sit (19.9±6.4; 33.5±5.8 s); but not flexibility (V-sit, 7.11±5.51; 
      4.23±4.50 cm). Chest press strength significantly increased for women trainers only 
      (2.7±2.2; 5.3±1.8 kg). Despite this, there were no significant differences for any 
      variable in the change from pre-to-post based on the sex of the trainer. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Both men and woman-led training was effective for increasing markers of 
      self-efficacy and fitness in woman clients.

TI  - Designing an Adaptive Adolescent Physical Activity and Nutrition Intervention for 
      COVID-19-Related Health Challenges: Formative Research Study.
PG  - e33322
LID - 10.2196/33322 [doi]
LID - e33322
AB  - BACKGROUND: With rates of childhood obesity continually increasing, effective 
      physical activity and nutrition interventions are needed. Formative research is used 
      to tailor interventions to different cultural and geographic contexts and can be 
      vital in adapting intervention strategies in the face of significant disruptive 
      circumstances (like COVID-19). OBJECTIVE: We conducted formative research via 
      in-person and web-based focus groups among middle schoolers and parents to better 
      understand the facilitators and barriers to physical activity and fruit and 
      vegetable consumption and to inform the design of a large intervention for a 
      low-income, urban setting in the US Midwest. METHODS: We conducted 2 phases of 
      qualitative focus groups with parents (n=20) and 6th-9th grade middle schoolers 
      (n=23). Phase 1 was conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019, and phase 
      2 was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic in the summer of 2020. Focus groups 
      were transcribed and thematically coded using the Dedoose software. RESULTS: The 
      main facilitators of physical activity prior to the pandemic included the 
      opportunity to have fun, peer influence, competition (for some), and incentives, 
      while the main barriers to physical activity were time constraints and social 
      discomfort. The main facilitators of eating fruits and vegetables included parental 
      influence, preparation technique, and convenience, while barriers included dislike 
      of vegetables, time constraints, and preparation or freshness. During the pandemic, 
      facilitators of physical activity remained the same, while additional barriers to 
      physical activity such as lack of motivation and limited time spent outside of the 
      home were reported. For fruit and vegetable consumption, both facilitators and 
      barriers remained the same for both time periods. Additionally, for some 
      participants, the pandemic offered an opportunity to offer more fruits and 
      vegetables to middle schoolers throughout the day. CONCLUSIONS: Some themes 
      identified were common to those reported in previous studies, such as peer influence 
      on physical activity and parental influence on fruit and vegetable consumption. 
      Novel themes such as lack of motivation to be active and limited time outside the 
      home helped improve intervention adaptation, specifically during the COVID-19 
      pandemic. The continuity of formative research after a major unexpected change in 
      the intervention context can be essential in targeting areas of an intervention that 
      can be retained and those that need to be adjusted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adults with an intellectual disability (ID) have low cardiorespiratory 
      fitness (CRF). Low CRF has been associated with a high risk of cardiovascular 
      disease and all-cause mortality. Participation in regular exercise can help adults 
      with ID increase their CRF. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis of published, peer-reviewed clinical trials that evaluated the effects 
      of aerobic exercise (AE) interventions on CRF in adults with ID, ages 18-65 years. 
      METHODS: English-language articles were searched up to June 2021 from 11 electronic 
      databases. Data were extracted using an author-developed form. Two independent 
      authors assessed the risk of bias using the Tool for the Assessment of Study Quality 
      and reporting in Exercise (TESTEX). Meta-analysis was performed using the RevMan 
      5.3. RESULTS: Of the 1870 article titles and abstracts screened, 16 articles were 
      included. The average TESTEX score (out of 15) was 8.1 (SD = 3.5, range 2-14). The 
      pooled effect was statistically significant (SMD = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.63, 
      z = 3.59; p = .000) with moderate heterogeneity (I(2) = 35%, p = .000). Both types 
      of intervention produced statistically significant CRF gains, with interventions 
      that combined AE with resistance, balance, and/or flexibility exercises being 
      slightly more effective (SMD = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.70, p = .007) than 
      non-combined interventions (SMD = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.79, p = .02). 
      Heterogeneity was moderate but non-significant for both types of intervention. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The review supports the use of AE interventions in promoting CRF in 
      adults with ID. The interpretation is limited by the quality of evidence and by 
      poorly described and/or executed familiarization and measurement protocols.

TI  - Aerobic Exercise Training-Induced Changes on DNA Methylation in Mild Cognitively 
      Impaired Elderly African Americans: Gene, Exercise, and Memory Study - GEMS-I.
PG  - 752403

AB  - BACKGROUND: DNA methylation at CpG sites is a vital epigenetic modification of the 
      human genome affecting gene expression, and potentially, health outcomes. However, 
      evidence is just budding on the effects of aerobic exercise-induced adaptation on 
      DNA methylation in older mild cognitively impaired (MCI) elderly African American 
      (AAs). Therefore, we examined the effects of a 6-month aerobic exercise-intervention 
      on genome-wide DNA methylation in elderly AA MCI volunteers. DESIGN: Elderly AA 
      volunteers confirmed MCI assigned into a 6-month program of aerobic exercise (eleven 
      participants) underwent a 40-min supervised-training 3-times/week and controls 
      (eight participants) performed stretch training. Participants had maximal oxygen 
      consumption (VO(2)max) test and Genome-wide methylation levels at CpG sites using 
      the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assay at baseline and after a 6-month 
      exercise program. We computed false discovery rates (FDR) using Sidak to account for 
      multiplicity of tests and performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain-reaction 
      (qRT-PCR) to confirm the effects of DNA methylations on expression levels of the top 
      5 genes among the aerobic participants. CpG sites identified from aerobic-exercise 
      participants were similarly analyzed by the stretch group to quantify the effects of 
      exercise-induced methylation changes among the group of stretch participants. 
      RESULTS: Eleven MCI participants (aerobic: 73% females; mean age 72.3 ± 6.6 years) 
      and eight MCI participants (stretch: 75% female; mean age 70.6 ± 6.7 years) 
      completed the training. Aerobic exercise-training was associated with increases in 
      VO(2)max and with global hypo- and hypermethylation changes. The most notable 
      finding was CpG hypomethylation within the body of the VPS52 gene (P = 5.4 × 
      10(-26)), a Golgi-associated protein, involved in intracellular protein trafficking 
      including amyloid precursor protein. qRT-PCR confirmed a nearly twofold increased 
      expression of VPS52. Other top findings with FDR q-value < 10(-5), include 
      hypomethylations of SCARB1 (8.8 × 10(-25)), ARTN (6.1 × 10(-25)), NR1H2 (2.1 × 
      10(-18)) and PPP2R5D (9.8 × 10(-18)). CONCLUSION: We conclude that genome-wide DNA 
      methylation patterns is associated with exercise training-induced methylation 
      changes. Identification of methylation changes around genes previously shown to 
      interact with amyloid biology, intracellular protein trafficking, and lipoprotein 
      regulations provide further support to the likely protective effect of exercise in 
      MCI. Future studies in larger samples are needed to confirm our findings.

TI  - Nutrient timing and metabolic regulation.
LID - 10.1113/JP280756 [doi]
AB  - Daily (circadian) rhythms coordinate our physiology and behaviour with regular 
      environmental changes. Molecular clocks in peripheral tissues (e.g. liver, skeletal 
      muscle and adipose) give rise to rhythms in macronutrient metabolism, appetite 
      regulation and the components of energy balance such that our bodies can align the 
      periodic delivery of nutrients with ongoing metabolic requirements. The timing of 
      meals both in absolute terms (i.e. relative to clock time) and in relative terms 
      (i.e. relative to other daily events) is therefore relevant to metabolism and 
      health. Experimental manipulation of feeding-fasting cycles can advance 
      understanding of the effect of absolute and relative timing of meals on metabolism 
      and health. Such studies have extended the overnight fast by regular breakfast 
      omission and revealed that morning fasting can alter the metabolic response to 
      subsequent meals later in the day, whilst also eliciting compensatory behavioural 
      responses (i.e. reduced physical activity). Similarly, restricting energy intake via 
      alternate-day fasting also has the potential to elicit a compensatory reduction in 
      physical activity, and so can undermine weight-loss efforts (i.e. to preserve body 
      fat stores). Interrupting the usual overnight fast (and therefore also the usual 
      sleep cycle) by nocturnal feeding has also been examined and further research is 
      needed to understand the importance of this period for either nutritional 
      intervention or nutritional withdrawal. In summary, it is important for dietary 
      guidelines for human health to consider nutrient timing (i.e. when we eat) alongside 
      the conventional focus on nutrient quantity and nutrient quality (i.e. how much we 
      eat and what we eat).

AB  - Objective: Gout is a crystal-induced inflammatory arthritis caused by elevated uric 
      acid. Physical activity has the potential to reduce serum uric acid (SUA), thus 
      improving the disease burden of gout. In this study, we examined the association of 
      objectively-measured physical activity and SUA. Methods: A cross-sectional study was 
      conducted using survey, laboratory, and accelerometer data from the 2003-2004 
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). SUA concentrations 
      (mg/dL) were obtained during an initial exam, and then physical activity (kCal/day) 
      was measured with 7 days of ActiGraph accelerometry in participants (n = 3,475) 
      representative of the ambulatory, non-institutionalized US civilian population. 
      Regression, including restricted cubic splines, was used to assess the relation of 
      physical activity and SUA in bivariate and adjusted models. Covariates included age, 
      gender, race/ethnicity, alcohol use, body mass index, renal function, and 
      urate-lowering therapy. Results: In the bivariate model, physical activity was 
      correlated with SUA concentrations and included a non-linear component (p < 0.01). 
      In the adjusted model, linear splines were employed with a node at the SUA nadir of 
      5.37mg/dL; this occurred at 703 kCal/day of physical activity. The association of 
      physical activity and SUA was negative from 0 to 703 kCal/day (p = 0.07) and 
      positive >703 kCal/day (p < 0.01 for the change in slope). Conclusion: Physical 
      activity and SUA are associated in a non-linear fashion, with a minimum estimated 
      SUA at 703 kCal/day of objectively-measured physical activity. These findings raise 
      intriguing questions about the use of physical activity as a potential adjunctive 
      therapy in patients with gout, and further interventional studies are needed to 
      elucidate the effects of moderate intensity exercise on SUA concentrations.

TI  - Benefits of a plant-based diet and considerations for the athlete.
LID - 10.1007/s00421-022-04902-w [doi]
AB  - Individuals may opt to follow a plant-based diet for a variety of reasons, such as 
      religious practices, health benefits or concerns for animal or environmental 
      welfare. Such diets offer a broad spectrum of health benefits including aiding in 
      the prevention and management of chronic diseases. In addition to health benefits, a 
      plant-based diet may provide performance-enhancing effects for various types of 
      exercise due to high carbohydrate levels and the high concentration of antioxidants 
      and phytochemicals found in a plant-based diet. However, some plant-based foods also 
      contain anti-nutrional factors, such as phytate and tannins, which decrease the 
      bioavailability of key nutrients, such as iron, zinc, and protein. Thus, plant-based 
      diets must be carefully planned to ensure adequate intake and absorption of energy 
      and all essential nutrients. The current narrative review summarizes the current 
      state of the research concerning the implications of a plant-based diet for health 
      and exercise performance. It also outlines strategies to enhance the bioavailability 
      of nutrients, sources of hard-to-get nutrients, and sport supplements that could 
      interest plant-based athletes.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and there is currently 
      no cure. Novel approaches to treat AD and curb the rapidly increasing worldwide 
      prevalence and costs of dementia are needed. Physical inactivity is a significant 
      modifiable risk factor for AD, estimated to contribute to 12.7% of AD cases 
      worldwide. Exercise interventions in humans and animals have shown beneficial 
      effects of exercise on brain plasticity and cognitive functions. In animal studies, 
      exercise also improved AD pathology. The mechanisms underlying these effects of 
      exercise seem to be associated mainly with exercise performance or cardiorespiratory 
      fitness. In addition, exercise-induced molecules of peripheral origin seem to play 
      an important role. Since exercise affects the whole body, there likely is no single 
      therapeutic target that could mimic all the benefits of exercise. However, systemic 
      strategies may be a viable means to convey broad therapeutic effects in AD patients. 
      Here, we review the potential of physical activity and exercise training in AD 
      prevention and treatment, shining light on recently discovered underlying mechanisms 
      and concluding with a view on future development of exercise-free treatment 
      strategies for AD.

TI  - The effects of exercise on the bone health of people with cancer: a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the pooled effect of exercise on the bone health of people 
      diagnosed with cancer. METHODS: Four electronic databases were systematically 
      searched. Controlled trials that assessed the effect of exercise on the bone mineral 
      density (BMD) or content (BMC) measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry or 
      peripheral quantitative computed tomography in people who had been diagnosed with 
      cancer were included in the study. Random-effect meta-analyses of effect size (ES) 
      were conducted. Sub-group analyses were performed to explore the influence of 
      intervention duration, prescription and participant characteristics. RESULTS: Of 66 
      full-text articles screened, 22 studies, from 21 interventions, were included 
      (primarily breast/prostate cancer, sample range n = 36-498). When all interventions 
      were grouped, a significant pooled ES was observed for exercise on hip (ES = 0.112, 
      95% CI: 0.026 to 0.198; p = 0.011) and lumbar spine BMD (ES = 0.269, 95% CI: 0.036 
      to 0.501; p = 0.024) compared to control. There was also an influence of sex, where 
      females had greater improvements in hip (ES = 0.120, 95% CI: 0.017 to 0.223; 
      p = 0.022) and spine BMD (ES = 0.415, 95% CI: 0.056 to 0.774; p = 0.23) compared to 
      males. CONCLUSION: Overall, exercise regimens of studies included in this review 
      appear to improve bone health at the hip and spine in people diagnosed with cancer. 
      Sub-analyses suggest some influence of sex, where females had greater improvements 
      in BMD compared to males. It is essential that future studies evaluate the 
      dose-response of exercise training on bone health and create exercise protocols that 
      better align with the laws of bone modelling to enhance osteogenic potential.

AB  - The cardiometabolic disorder (CMD) is a syndrome caused by coalescing of 
      cardiovascular, endocrine, pro-thrombotic, and inflammatory health risks. Together, 
      these risks confer a hazard as health-threatening as coronary artery disease or 
      type2 diabetes, whether an individual has a diagnosis of coronary disease or 
      diabetes, or not. CMD is most often defined by three or more of five clinically 
      assessed risk components, notably obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, 
      hypertriglyceridemia, and depressed high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Evidence 
      currently suggests that worldwide CMD is expanding at a pandemic rate, and it is 
      known that people living with spinal cord injuries (SCI) qualify for the diagnosis 
      at more than 50% of the prevalence of a non-disabled cohort. A recent evidence-based 
      guideline warned of the current state of CMD following SCI and recommended early 
      lifestyle intervention incorporating exercise and prudent nutrition as a first-line 
      disease countermeasure. This monograph will define the CMD following SCI, explore 
      its underlying pathophysiology, and provide evidence that recommends exercise for 
      CMD health hazards after SCI.

AB  - The effects of exercise in conjunction with weight-loss diets on bone health are 
      mixed. Our objective was to systematically review and meta-analyze controlled 
      clinical trials in adults investigating the addition of exercise to a weight-loss 
      diet compared with a calorie-matched weight-loss diet without exercise on bone 
      measures. Online databases including PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI (Web of Science), 
      Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched up to April 2021 with no restriction. A 
      random effects model was used to calculate the overall estimates. Quality of 
      evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development 
      and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Fourteen eligible controlled clinical trials 
      were included in the systematic review. The meta-analysis revealed that, compared to 
      weight-loss diets alone, the addition of exercise did not improve total body bone 
      mineral density (BMD) [weighted mean difference (WMD) = 0.002 g/cm(2), P = 0.62, 
      n = 8], lumbar BMD (WMD = 0.007 g/cm(2), P = 0.44, n = 9), total hip BMD 
      (WMD = 0.015 g/cm(2), P = 0.14, n = 4) and total bone mineral content (BMC) 
      (WMD =  - 11.97 g, P = 0.29, n = 7). Subgroup analysis revealed that resistance 
      exercise in conjunction with hypocaloric diets positively affects total BMD compared 
      to an energy restrictive diet alone (WMD = 0.01 g/cm(2), P = 0.003, n = 3). Overall, 
      it appears that only resistance exercise beneficially affects total BMD during a 
      calorie-restricted diet in adults. Further well-controlled and long-term clinical 
      trials are still needed to confirm these results. PROSPERO registration number:

AB  - In aerospace medicine, the focus is on prevention of disease when physically healthy 
      individuals, pilots, and astronauts often screened to the point of extraordinary 
      health, are then placed in a hostile environment. To help mitigate the effects of 
      oxygen, pressure and temperature fluctuations as well as other environmental 
      considerations such as microgravity, all of which have a significant impact on 
      wellness, the cornerstones of health maintenance in the aerospace environment are 
      eating and exercise habits. In a relatively short duration in an aeronautic 
      environment, the rewards of terrestrial diligence pay off particularly in high G 
      environments such as military aircraft, where deconditioning and dehydration place 
      the pilot at increased risk for loss of consciousness (LOC). Another example is in 
      protracted air travel such as international flights where deconditioning, 
      dehydration, and immobility increase the risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in a 
      traveler. Health maintenance and wellness pose a much greater challenge in space.  
      In space, all food must be carried and stored on the ship. An important 
      consideration is that nutrition and conditioning will need to be maintained for the 
      duration of any mission; an exploration of Mars, for example, will take 
      approximately 2.5 years. Space travel is not yet as common as commercial air travel, 
      where there may be no screening for pre-existing health conditions and any age 
      considerations will be self-imposed.

TI  - Implications of the Gut Microbiome in Sports.
PG  - 19417381211060006
LID - 10.1177/19417381211060006 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Two-thirds of an individual's gut microbiota is unique and influenced by 
      dietary and exercise habits, age, sex, genetics, ethnicity, antibiotics, health, and 
      disease. It plays important roles in nutrient and vitamin metabolism, inflammatory 
      modulation, immune system function, and overall health of an individual. 
      Specifically, in sports it may help decrease recovery time and improve athletic 
      performance. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: PubMed and Medline databases were used for the 
      literature search. Bibliographies based on the original search were utilized to 
      pursue further literature search. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 
      Level 4. RESULTS: Diet and exercise play very important roles in the composition of 
      the gut microbiota in the athletic and nonathletic individual. Ingestion of 
      carbohydrates during and after exercise seems to have an anti-inflammatory effect 
      postexercise. Supplementation with probiotic seems to aid in recovery after 
      exercise, too, especially restoring the "normal" gut microbiota. Physically active 
      individuals of all levels have more alpha diversity and "health-promoting gut 
      species" in their microbiome than nonactive individuals, along with higher 
      concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and SCFA-producing organisms. 
      However, exercise interventions should be longer than 8 weeks to see these positive 
      characteristics. Immune function is highly influenced by the gut microbiota's 
      response to exercise. A transient immune dysfunction occurs after prolonged 
      high-intensity exercise, which correlates with microbiota dysregulation. 
      Nevertheless, long-term exposure to exercise will enhance the immune response and 
      lead to positive changes in the gut microbiota. CONCLUSION: Although the exact 
      mechanisms of the effects that diet, exercise, and genetics have on the gut 
      microbiota remain largely unknown, there is evidence that suggests overall health 
      benefits. In the athletic population, these benefits can ultimately lead to 
      performance improvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the associations of domain-specific 
      physical activity (PA) with the prevalence of depressive symptoms. METHODS: We 
      analyzed data from 11,679 (5,056 men and 6,623 women) participants aged ³19 years in 
      the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2016 and 2018 waves). 
      Depressive symptoms were measured using the Korean version of the Patient Health 
      Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), with a cut-off score for depression of 11. The participants 
      were first categorized by sex, and then by their PA level in different PA domains 
      into three different groups. We examined the correlations between domain-specific PA 
      and depressive symptoms using logistic regression analysis after controlling for 
      confounders. RESULTS: Total amount of PA was not associated with depressive 
      symptoms. However, in both sexes, those high in leisure and transport PA had lower 
      levels of depressive symptoms compared with those with no leisure and transport PA 
      (p for trend <0.001). After adjusting for covariates, those high in work PA showed a 
      significantly higher likelihood of having depressive symptoms both in male (OR= 
      2.74, 95% CI 1.56-4.82) and female participants (OR= 2.84, 95% CI 1.70-4.49), 
      compared to those with no work PA. LIMITATION: Cross-sectional nature of the data 
      prevents causal associations. CONCLUSIONS: Although the total amount of PA 
      participation was not associated with depressive symptoms, domain-specific PAs were 
      differently associated with depressive symptoms. Specifically, higher amount of work 
      PA was significantly associated with higher prevalence of depressive symptoms; this 
      topic deserves further attention and future investigation.

TI  - A single bout of cycling exercise induces nucleosome repositioning in the skeletal

AB  - AIM: To compare the molecular and metabolic effects of a single exercise bout in the 
      skeletal muscle between lean and overweight/obese (Ov/Ob) individuals. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Participants recruited were men, aged 19-30 years, who were either lean 
      (body mass index [BMI] < 25, 18.5-24.1 kg/m(2) ; n = 15) or Ov/Ob (BMI ≥ 25, 
      25.5-36.9 kg/m(2) ; n = 15). Four hours after a high-carbohydrate breakfast 
      (7 kcal/kg; 60% carbohydrate, 25% fat, 15% protein), participants performed a 
      cycling exercise (50% VO(2) max, expending ~650 kcal). Muscle biopsies and 
      peripheral blood samples were collected 30 minutes before the meal and immediately 
      after exercise. Blood analysis, and muscle acylcarnitine profiles, transcriptomics, 
      and nucleosome mapping by micrococcal nuclease digestion with deep sequencing were 
      performed. RESULTS: A single exercise bout improved blood metabolite profiles in 
      both lean and Ov/Ob individuals. Muscle long-chain acylcarnitines were increased in 
      Ov/Ob compared with lean participants, but were not altered by exercise. A single 
      exercise bout increased the mRNA abundance of genes related to mitochondria and 
      insulin signalling in both lean and Ov/Ob participants. Nucleosome mapping by 
      micrococcal nuclease digestion with deep sequencing revealed that exercise 
      repositioned the -1 nucleosome away from the transcription start site of the PGC1a 
      promoter and of other mitochondrial genes, but did not affect genes related to 
      insulin signalling, in both lean and Ov/Ob participants. CONCLUSION: These data 
      suggest that a single exercise bout induced epigenetic alterations in skeletal 
      muscle in a BMI-independent manner.

AB  - Families face many barriers in providing nutritious home-cooked family meals. Meal 
      kit subscription services are increasingly popular among families and may address 
      obstacles to cooking at home and facilitate shared family meals. This study aimed to 
      understand why families use meal kits and what they perceived to be the main impacts 
      on family dynamics, nutrition, social and mental health. Sixteen primary meal 
      providers with at least one child 18 years and under living at home, were recruited 
      via social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) to participate in a semi-structured 
      interview using Zoom videoconferencing. Interviews were conducted with participants 
      who currently purchased and used commercially available meal kits in Australia 
      (e.g., HelloFresh, Marley Spoon). Thematic analysis of interview transcripts 
      revealed that women, as the primary carers responsible for family meals, primarily 
      reported the role that meal kits played in reducing their mental load through 
      reduced food-related decision making, enhanced family participation in meal 
      preparation, and opportunities for food literacy. Additionally, meal kits were 
      reported to reduce food eaten away-from-home with the majority of participants 
      perceiving meal kits to provide nutritionally dense meals and appropriate portion 
      sizes aligned with National dietary guidelines. This study provides important 
      insights into the potential physical, mental and social health benefits of meal kits 
      in supporting families to cook and eat meals together at home. While meal kits have 
      the capacity to positively influence population health and wellbeing, it is 
      necessary that meal kit subscription services address the nutritional quality of 
      their meals and provide evidence-based nutrition messaging to facilitate 
      improvements in food literacy and nutritional intake.

TI  - Exercise/Physical Activity in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes: A Consensus 
      Statement from the American College of Sports Medicine.
PG  - 353-368
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000002800 [doi]
AB  - This consensus statement is an update of the 2010 American College of Sports 
      Medicine position stand on exercise and type 2 diabetes. Since then, a substantial 
      amount of research on select topics in exercise in individuals of various ages with 
      type 2 diabetes has been published while diabetes prevalence has continued to expand 
      worldwide. This consensus statement provides a brief summary of the current evidence 
      and extends and updates the prior recommendations. The document has been expanded to 
      include physical activity, a broader, more comprehensive definition of human 
      movement than planned exercise, and reducing sedentary time. Various types of 
      physical activity enhance health and glycemic management in people with type 2 
      diabetes, including flexibility and balance exercise, and the importance of each 
      recommended type or mode are discussed. In general, the 2018 Physical Activity 
      Guidelines for Americans apply to all individuals with type 2 diabetes, with a few 
      exceptions and modifications. People with type 2 diabetes should engage in physical 
      activity regularly and be encouraged to reduce sedentary time and break up sitting 
      time with frequent activity breaks. Any activities undertaken with acute and chronic 
      health complications related to diabetes may require accommodations to ensure safe 
      and effective participation. Other topics addressed are exercise timing to maximize 
      its glucose-lowering effects and barriers to and inequities in physical activity 
      adoption and maintenance.

TI  - Salbutamol Increases Leg Glucose Uptake and Metabolic Rate but not Muscle Glycogen 
      Resynthesis in Recovery From Exercise.
PG  - e1193-e1203
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgab752 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Exercise blunts the effect of beta2-agonists on peripheral glucose uptake 
      and energy expenditure. Whether such attenuation extends into recovery is unknown. 
      OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of a beta2-agonist on leg glucose uptake and 
      metabolic rate in recovery from exercise. METHODS: Using leg arteriovenous balance 
      technique and analyses of thigh muscle biopsies, we investigated the effect of a 
      beta2-agonist (24 mg of oral salbutamol) vs placebo on leg glucose, lactate, and 
      oxygen exchange before and during quadriceps exercise, and 0.5 to 5 hours in 
      recovery from quadriceps exercise, as well as on muscle glycogen resynthesis and 
      activity in recovery. Twelve healthy, lean, young men participated. RESULTS: Before 
      exercise, leg glucose uptake was 0.42 ± 0.12 and 0.20 ± 0.02 mmol × min-1 
      (mean ± SD) for salbutamol and placebo (P = .06), respectively, while leg oxygen 
      consumption was around 2-fold higher (P < .01) for salbutamol than for placebo 
      (25 ± 3 vs 14 ± 1 mL × min-1). No treatment differences were observed in leg glucose 
      uptake, lactate release, and oxygen consumption during exercise. But in recovery, 
      cumulated leg glucose uptake, lactate release, and oxygen consumption was 21 mmol 
      (95% CI 18-24, P = .018), 19 mmol (95% CI 16-23, P < .01), and 1.8 L (95% CI 
      1.6-2.0, P < .01) higher for salbutamol than for placebo, respectively. Muscle 
      glycogen content was around 30% lower (P < .01) for salbutamol than for placebo in 
      recovery, whereas no treatment differences were observed in muscle glycogen 
      resynthesis or glycogen synthase activity. CONCLUSION: Exercise blunts the effect of 
      beta2-agonist salbutamol on leg glucose uptake, but this attenuation diminishes in 
      recovery. Salbutamol increases leg lactate release in recovery, which may relate to 
      glycolytic trafficking due to excessive myocellular glucose uptake.

AB  - PURPOSE: Reduced lean body mass (LBM) is common during and after treatment for 
      breast cancer, and it is associated with increased treatment-induced toxicity, 
      shorter time to tumor progression, and decreased survival. Exercise training is a 
      potential intervention for maintaining or increasing LBM. We conducted a systematic 
      review and a meta-analysis to investigate the effects of exercise training on LBM in 
      breast cancer. METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed to November 2020 for 
      randomized controlled trials reporting the effects of structured exercise training 
      on LBM compared with control in women with breast cancer during or after cancer 
      treatment. A random-effects meta-analysis was completed using the absolute net 
      difference in the change in LBM between intervention and control groups as the 
      outcome measure. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were also performed. RESULTS: 
      Data from 17 studies involving 1743 breast cancer survivors were included in the 
      meta-analysis. Overall, there was a significant benefit of exercise training 
      compared with control on LBM (0.58 kg, 95% confidence interval = 0.27 to 0.88, P < 
      0.001). Subgroup analysis showed positive effects for resistance training (0.59 kg) 
      and aerobic training (0.29 kg), and for exercise training conducted during (0.47 kg) 
      or after (0.66 kg) cancer treatment. Exercise training was beneficial in studies 
      enrolling postmenopausal women (0.58 kg) as well as in those with participants of 
      mixed menopausal status (1.46 kg). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with usual care, exercise 
      training has a beneficial effect on LBM in women with breast cancer, both during and 
      after cancer treatment. Given the physiological and functional importance of LBM in 
      women with breast cancer, oncologists should encourage their patients to engage in 
      regular exercise training, with particular emphasis on resistance training.

TI  - A systematic review of temporal body weight and dietary intake patterns in adults: 
      implications on future public health nutrition interventions to promote healthy 
      weight.
LID - 10.1007/s00394-021-02791-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The global prevalence of overweight remains high; effective strategies that 
      consider patterns of body weight changes to identify periods when adults are 
      susceptible to weight gain are warranted. This systematic review aimed to 
      investigate body weight patterns, and how they were associated with dietary intake 
      and/or dietary behaviours (Prospero CRD42020161977). METHODS: Systematic literature 
      search was conducted in the Medline, Embase, and CINAHL databases until November 
      2020. Observational studies in adults (18 years and over) that reported at least two 
      measurements of weight and dietary intake in a year were included. Risk of bias was 
      conducted using the Evidence Analysis Library by the Academy of Nutrition and 
      Dietetics tool. This review included 16 unique studies after title, abstract, and 
      full-text screening, and findings were narratively synthesised. RESULTS: Of the six 
      studies conducted in the farming populations, five were conducted in countries with 
      two seasons (dry vs. rainy seasons) and all studies observed higher body weight 
      during the dry season (up to 3.1 kg difference between seasons). The remaining study 
      was conducted in a sub-tropical country and did not observe temporal weight 
      patterns. Higher dietary intake was also reported during the dry season in the 
      tropical countries. In non-farming populations (n = 10), temporal patterns were also 
      seen, where higher body weight and adiposity was observed during colder seasons 
      (autumn and winter). However, the opposite was found in a study conducted in Iran, 
      where higher weight was seen in summer. Concurrent with higher body weight, higher 
      energy, fat, carbohydrate and soda consumption, and lower fiber and vegetable intake 
      were observed. CONCLUSION: Temporal weight and dietary patterns exist, and they were 
      country- and context-specific; these patterns were also related to factors such as 
      activity levels, seasons and occupation. Future interventions should consider 
      temporal patterns in the design and delivery of timely and tailored dietary 
      interventions to promote optimal body weight. PROSPERO REGISTRATION: PROSPERO

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Degenerative diseases are associated with lower healthy life expectancy 
      and higher mortality. Physical activity (PA) has demonstrated a fundamental role in 
      the prevention and control of several pathologies associated to the aging process. 
      The aim of this study was to analyze the association of PA with the prevalence of 
      sarcopenia, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis in non-institutionalized American 
      population. METHODS: Cross-sectional study carried out in participants aged 
      ≥50 years from the 1999-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
      (NHANES). Sarcopenia was defined using appendicular lean mass adjusted for body mass 
      index (ALM:BMI; men <0.789 kg/m(2), women <0.512 kg/m(2)). Osteoporosis was defined 
      as bone mineral density T-score ≤-2.5 of femur neck. Osteoarthritis and PA were 
      self-reported, and total PA was used to classify participants in groups. The Odds 
      Ratios among the different PA levels for each disease were examined. RESULTS: 
      Performing at least 150 MET-min/week of PA was associated with reduced odds for 
      sarcopenia; performing >1800 MET-min/week was associated with reduced odds for 
      osteoporosis; and performing 150-1800 MET-min/week of PA was associated with reduced 
      odds for osteoarthritis after adjust the results by several confounders. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of PA in sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis 
      prevention are evident among Americans aged ≥50 years.

AB  - A diet high in saturated fat leads to skeletal muscle deteriorations including 
      insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction and muscle fiber atrophy. Consumption 
      of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and exercise have shown promise in 
      ameliorating high-fat diet (HFD)-induced oxidative stress and inflammation. However, 
      the impact of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on mitochondrial homeostasis in muscle 
      is largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate whether 12 wks of EVOO feeding 
      alone and in conjunction with endurance training could protect against metabolic and 
      mitochondrial dysfunction rat muscle with HFD. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were 
      divided into 4 groups fed a control diet (C), HFD, EVOO diet, and EVOO diet with 
      training (EVOO+T). Mitochondrial enzyme activity and protein content decreased with 
      HFD compared to C, but were restored with EVOO and EVOO+T. EVOO+T elevated muscle 
      cytochrome c and PGC-1α levels. HFD increased muscle proteolytic markers and protein 
      ubiquitination, whereas these effects were not seen in EVOO and EVOO+T. HFD 
      suppressed mitochondrial fusion protein level while increasing fission protein 
      levels, but were restored with EVOO and EVOO+T. Mitophagy marker PINK1 content 
      decreased with HFD, but was unchanged in EVOO and EVOO+T. EVOO+T upregulated 
      autophagy markers, along with decreased phosphorylated/dephosphorylated FoxO3 ratio. 
      Antioxidants enzyme levels were upregulated by EVOO and EVOO+T, and EVOO+T reduced 
      HFD-induced lipid peroxidation. In conclusion, HFD impaired muscle oxidative 
      capacity, promoted protein ubiquitination and mitochondrial fission, and upregulated 
      autophagy markers. Replacement of HFD with EVOO corrected the observed adverse 
      effects, while exercise training in conjunction with EVOO provided additional 
      protection to the muscle.

AB  - AIM: This review aims to summarize and discuss some of the most relevant clinical 
      trials in epidemiology, diagnostics, and treatment of hypertension published in 2020 
      and 2021. DATA SYNTHESIS: The trials included in this review are related to 
      hypertension onset age and risk for future cardiovascular disease, reliability of 
      different blood pressure monitoring methods, role of exercise-induced hypertension, 
      treatment of hypertension in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, management of 
      hypertension high-risk patient groups, e.g., in the elderly (≥80 years) and patients 
      with atrial fibrillation, and the interplay between nutrition and hypertension, as 
      well as recent insights into renal denervation for treatment of hypertension. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension onset age, nighttime blood pressure levels and a riser 
      pattern are relevant for the prognosis of future cardiovascular diseases. The risk 
      of coronary heart disease appears to increase linearly with increasing exercise 
      systolic blood pressure. Renin-angiotensin system blockers are not associated with 
      an increased risk for a severe course of COVID-19. In elderly patients, a 
      risk-benefit assessment of intensified blood pressure control should be individually 
      evaluated. A J-shaped association between cardiovascular disease and achieved blood 
      pressure could also be demonstrated in patients with atrial fibrillation on 
      anticoagulation. Salt restriction and lifestyle modification remain effective 
      options in treating hypertensive patients at low cardiovascular risk. Sodium glucose 
      co-transporter 2 inhibitors and Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists show 
      BP-lowering effects. Renal denervation should be considered as an additional or 
      alternative treatment option in selected patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

TI  - The Effect of Pre-operative Exercise Intervention on Patient Outcomes Following 
      Bariatric Surgery: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 160-169

AB  - This systematic review aimed to assess the effect of a pre-operative exercise 
      intervention on short- and long-term health and clinical outcomes for adult patients 
      undergoing bariatric surgery (BS). We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central 
      Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), SPORTDiscus and reference lists of relevant 
      papers, through March 2021. Five randomised controlled trials were included (n = 199 
      patients). Modest increases in cardiorespiratory fitness (VO(2max)) were found at 
      both pre-operative (0.73 mL kg(-1) min(-1), P ≤ 0.001) and maximum follow-up time 
      points (0.98 mL kg(-1) min(-1), P ≤ 0.04). There was no significant effect of an 
      exercise intervention on percentage total weight loss (%TWL). Pre-operative exercise 
      can induce significant short- and long-term improvements in fitness in individuals 
      with obesity. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether pre-operative 
      training impacts other post-operative clinical outcomes.

TI  - Methods to match high-intensity interval exercise intensity in hypoxia and normoxia 
      - A pilot study.
PG  - 70-76
LID - 10.1016/j.jesf.2021.12.003 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) 
      sessions prescribed on the basis of a maximal value (peak power output, PPO) and a 
      submaximal value (lactate threshold, LT) derived from graded exercise tests (GXTs) 
      in normoxia and hypoxia. METHODS: A total of ten males (aged 18-37) volunteered to 
      participate in this study. The experimental protocol consisted of a familiarization 
      procedure, two GXTs under normoxia (FiO(2) = 0.209) and two GXTs under normobaric 
      hypoxia (FiO2 = 0.140), and three HIIE sessions performed in a random order. The 
      HIIE sessions included one at hypoxia (HY) and two at normoxia (one matched for the 
      absolute intensity in hypoxia, designated as NA, and one matched for the relative 
      intensity in hypoxia, designated as NR). RESULTS: The data demonstrated that there 
      was significant lower peak oxygen uptake (V̇O(2peak)), peak heart rate (HR(peak)), 
      PPO, and LT derived from GXTs in hypoxia, with higher respiratory exchange ratio 
      (RER), when compared to those from GXTs performed in normoxia (p < 0.001). Among the 
      three HIIE sessions, the NA session resulted in lower percentage of HR(peak) 
      (85.0 ± 7.5% vs 94.4 ± 5.0%; p = 0.002) and V̇O(2peak) (74.1 ± 9.1% vs 88.7 ± 7.7%; 
      p = 0.005), when compared to the NR session. HIIE sessions in HY and NR resulted in 
      similar percentage of HR(peak) and V̇O(2peak), as well as similar rating of 
      perceived exertion and RER. The blood lactate level increased immediately after all 
      the three HIIE sessions (p < 0.001), while higher blood lactate concentrations were 
      observed immediately after the HY (p = 0.0003) and NR (p = 0.014) sessions when 
      compared with NA. CONCLUSION: Combining of PPO and LT derived from GXTs can be used 
      to prescribe exercise intensity of HIIE in hypoxia.

TI  - Effect of a 12-week home-based exercise training program on aerobic capacity, muscle 
      mass, liver and spleen stiffness, and quality of life in cirrhotic patients: a 
      randomized controlled clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity and sarcopenia are two important predictors 
      associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis. At 
      present, the benefit of a home-based exercise training program is not well 
      established in cirrhotic patients. The main objective of this study was to evaluate 
      the effect of a 12-week home-based exercise training program on aerobic capacity in 
      cirrhotic patients. METHODS: This is a randomized controlled study. Patients with 
      compensated cirrhosis were randomized by a block of 4 with concealed allocation to 
      the home-based exercise training (n = 20) or control (n = 20). Both groups received 
      protein supplementation (9 g/day) for 12 weeks. The home-based exercise training 
      program included several aerobic/isotonic moderate-intensity continuous training 
      exercises for 40 min per session, at least four times a week, with a total duration 
      of 12 weeks. The heart rate was continuously monitored using a Garmin® watch. In the 
      control group, patients received exercise instruction without active encouragement 
      and continuous monitoring. The primary outcome was a change in the 6-min walk test 
      from baseline. Secondary outcomes were the difference in thigh muscle thickness, 
      liver stiffness, spleen stiffness, and quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 40 
      patients were enrolled prospectively. The mean age was 56.3 ± 7.8 years, with a male 
      predominance of 65%. The mean body mass index was 25.23 ± 3.0 kg/m(2), and all were 
      Child-Pugh A. Chronic hepatitis B or C was the primary cause of cirrhosis. The 
      baseline values were a 6-min walk test of 475 ± 70 m, liver stiffness of 
      15.3 ± 9.3 kPa, spleen stiffness of 29.8 ± 21.7 kPa, and thigh muscle thickness 
      (average compression index) of 0.64 ± 0.2 cm/m(2). All baseline characteristics 
      between the two groups were not different except the mean muscle mass which was 
      significantly higher in the home-based exercise training group (p = 0.03, 95% CI 
      0.01 to 0.17). At the end of the study, no significant difference in the 6-min walk 
      test was observed (p = 0.36, 95% CI -15.5 to 41.7). Liver stiffness measurement 
      significantly improved in both groups, but no significant difference between groups 
      was demonstrated (p = 0.77, 95% CI -1.3 to 1.8). Thigh muscle thickness was not 
      different between groups. The fatigue domain of the quality of life index was 
      significantly improved in the home-based exercise training group compared with the 
      control group (p = 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.67). No adverse events occurred in a 
      home-based exercise training program. CONCLUSIONS: A 12-week moderate-intensity 
      home-based exercise training program in compensated cirrhotic patients significantly 
      improved the fatigue domain of the quality of life index without an increase in 
      adverse events. However, no benefit in terms of aerobic capacity, thigh muscle mass, 
      liver stiffness, and spleen stiffness was demonstrated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Thai

      Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 834812

LID - 834812
AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-exercise hypotension (PEH) can be an important non-pharmacological 
      strategy in the treatment of arterial hypertension. Both aerobic and resistance 
      exercises produce PEH, but it is not clear if the exercise environment can lead to a 
      higher PEH. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis investigated whether a session of aquatic 
      exercise (AE) induces PEH in comparison with control conditions such as land 
      exercise (LE) or rest in hypertensive subjects. METHODS: The present systematic 
      review and meta-analysis was conducted using the following electronic databases: 
      PubMed, Google Scholar, and EMBASE. Ambulatory blood pressure measurements made in 
      randomized clinical trials were pooled to compare PEH induced by AE with LE and rest 
      conditions in hypertensive subjects. RESULTS: Data from four trials were included, 
      which comprised 127 participants (94 women and 33 men). A 24-h analysis did not 
      detect significant differences between AE and LE or rest for either systolic blood 
      pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Monitoring during the night showed 
      that AE induced significant PEH in comparison with LE for SBP [-8.6 (-15.0 to -1.5) 
      mmHg (p = 0.01)]. For DBP, the AE had pronounced PEH during the night in comparison 
      with LE [-3.7 (-4.7 to -2.8) mmHg, p = 0.000] and rest [-1.7 (-1.9 to -0.8) mmHg, p 
      = 0.000]. There were no differences in daytime values. CONCLUSION: AE showed a 
      higher PEH effect than LE sessions and rest conditions. PEH was observed in both SBP 
      and DBP during the night. The number of studies was low, but all studies included in 
      this meta-analysis used 24-h monitoring. The understanding of clinical relevance of 
      AE, inducing a higher PEH, depends on a standardization of exercise protocols plus a 
      rigorous monitoring of blood pressure. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO

TI  - CHOP is dispensable for exercise-induced increases in GDF15.
PG  - 413-422

AB  - Growth differentiating factor-15 (GDF15) is expressed, and secreted, from a wide 
      range of tissues and serves as a marker of cellular stress. A key transcriptional 
      regulator of this hormone is the endoplasmic reticulum stress protein, CHOP (C/EBP 
      homologous protein). Exercise increases GDF15 levels but the underlying mechanisms 
      of this are not known. To test whether CHOP regulates GDF15 during exercise, we used 
      various models of altered ER stress. We examined the effects of acute exercise on 
      circulating GDF15 and Gdf15 mRNA expression in liver, triceps skeletal muscle, and 
      epididymal white adipose tissue and examined the GDF15 response to acute exercise in 
      lean and high-fat diet-induced obese mice, sedentary and exercise trained mice, and 
      CHOP-deficient mice. We found that obesity augments exercise-induced circulating 
      GDF15 although ER stress markers were similar in lean and obese mice. 
      Exercise-induced GDF15 was increased in trained and sedentary mice that ran at the 
      same relative exercise intensity, despite trained mice being protected against 
      increased markers of ER stress. Finally, exercise-induced increases in GDF15 at the 
      tissue and whole body level were intact in CHOP-deficient mice. Together, these 
      results provide evidence that exercise-induced GDF15 expression and secretion occurs 
      independent of ER stress/CHOP.NEW & NOTEWORTHY GDF15 is expressed in a wide range of 
      tissues, is a marker of cellular stress, and has been shown to be regulated by the 
      ER stress protein CHOP. Although exercise increases GDF15, the mechanisms mediating 
      this effect have not been elucidated. Using various models of altered ER stress, we 
      demonstrate that exercise-induced increases in GDF15 occur independent of ER 
      stress/CHOP.

TI  - Chronic fine particulate matter exposure, habitual exercise, and dyslipidemia: A 
      longitudinal cohort study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical activity may increase the intake of air pollutants due to a 
      higher ventilation rate, which may exacerbate the adverse health effects. This study 
      investigated the combined effects of habitual exercise and long-term exposure to 
      fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) on the incidence of dyslipidemia in a large 
      longitudinal cohort in Taiwan. METHODS: A total of 121,948 adults (≥18 years) who 
      received at least two medical examinations from 2001 to 2016 were recruited, 
      yielding 407,821 medical examination records. A satellite-based spatiotemporal model 
      was used to estimate the 2-year average PM(2.5) concentration (i.e., the year of and 
      the year before the medical examination) at each participant's address. Information 
      on habitual exercise within 1 month before the medical examination was collected 
      using a standard self-administered questionnaire. A Cox regression model with 
      time-dependent covariates was used to investigate the combined effects. RESULTS: 
      Compared with inactivity, moderate and high levels of exercise were associated with 
      a lower incidence of dyslipidemia, with hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence 
      intervals [CIs]) of 0.91 (0.88, 0.94) and 0.73 (0.71, 0.75), respectively. 
      Participants with a moderate (22.37-25.96 μg/m(3)) or high (>25.96 μg/m(3)) level of 
      PM(2.5) exposure had a higher incidence of dyslipidemia than those with a low level 
      of PM(2.5) exposure (≤22.37 μg/m(3)), with HRs (95% CIs) of 1.36 (1.32, 1.40), and 
      1.90 (1.81, 1.99), respectively. We observed a statistically significant, but minor, 
      interaction effect of PM(2.5) exposure and exercise on the development of 
      dyslipidemia, with an overall hazard ratios (95% CI) of 1.08 (1.05, 1.10), 
      indicating that an incremental increase in the level of exercise was associated with 
      an 8% increase in the risk of dyslipidemia associated with every 10 μg/m(3) increase 
      in PM(2.5) exposure. However, the negative association between habitual exercise and 
      dyslipidemia remained, regardless of the level of PM(2.5) exposure, suggesting that 
      the benefits of increased habitual exercise outweighed the adverse effects of the 
      increase in PM(2.5) intake during exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of 
      exercise and reduced levels of PM(2.5) exposures were associated with a lower 
      incidence of dyslipidemia. Although an increase in habitual exercise slightly 
      increased the risk of dyslipidemia associated with PM(2.5) exposure, the benefits of 
      the increased habitual exercise outweighed the risks. Our findings suggest that 
      habitual exercise is an effective approach for dyslipidemia prevention, even for 
      people residing in relatively polluted areas.

TI  - Acute Ingestion of Ketone Monoesters and Precursors Do Not Enhance Endurance 
      Exercise Performance: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 1-12

AB  - There has been much consideration over whether exogenous ketone bodies have the 
      capacity to enhance exercise performance through mechanisms such as altered 
      substrate metabolism, accelerated recovery, or neurocognitive improvements. This 
      systematic review aimed to determine the effects of both ketone precursors and 
      monoesters on endurance exercise performance. A systematic search was conducted in 
      PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and CINAHL for randomized controlled trials investigating 
      endurance performance outcomes in response to ingestion of a ketone supplement 
      compared to a nutritive or nonnutritive control in humans. A meta-analysis was 
      performed to determine the standardized mean difference between interventions using 
      a random-effects model. Hedge's g and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. 
      The search yielded 569 articles, of which eight were included in this review (80 
      participants; 77 men and three women). When comparing endurance performance among 
      all studies, no significant differences were found between ketone and control trials 
      (Hedges g = 0.136; 95% CI [-0.195, 0.467]; p = .419). Subanalyses based on type of 
      endurance tests showed no significant differences in time to exhaustion (Hedge's g = 
      -0.002; 95% CI [-0.312, 0.308]; p = .989) or time trial (Hedge's g = 0.057; 95% CI 
      [-0.282, 0.395]; p = .744) values. Based on these findings, exogenous ketone 
      precursors and monoesters do not exert significant improvements on endurance 
      exercise performance. While all studies reported an increase in blood ketone 
      concentrations after ingestion, ketone monoesters appear to be more effective at 
      raising concentrations than precursors.

TI  - Exercise-Based Interventions to Counteract Skeletal Muscle Mass Loss in People with 
      Cancer: Can We Overcome the Odds?
LID - 10.1007/s40279-021-01638-z [doi]
AB  - Addressing skeletal muscle mass loss is an important focus in oncology research to 
      improve clinical outcomes, including cancer treatment tolerability and survival. 
      Exercise is likely a necessary component of muscle-mass-preserving interventions for 
      people with cancer. However, randomized controlled trials with exercise that include 
      people with cancer with increased susceptibility to more rapid and severe muscle 
      mass loss are limited. The aim of the current review is to highlight features of 
      cancer-related skeletal muscle mass loss, discuss the impact in patients most at 
      risk, and describe the possible role of exercise as a management strategy. We 
      present current gaps within the exercise oncology literature and offer several 
      recommendations for future studies to support research translation, including (1) 
      utilizing accurate and reliable body composition techniques to assess changes in 
      skeletal muscle mass, (2) incorporating comprehensive assessments of patient health 
      status to allow personalized exercise prescription, (3) coupling exercise with 
      robust nutritional recommendations to maximize the impact on skeletal muscle 
      outcomes, and (4) considering key exercise intervention features that may improve 
      exercise efficacy and adherence. Ultimately, the driving forces behind skeletal 
      muscle mass loss are complex and may impede exercise tolerability and efficacy. Our 
      recommendations are intended to foster the design of high-quality patient-centred 
      research studies to determine whether exercise can counteract muscle mass loss in 
      people with cancer and, as such, improve knowledge on this topic.

TI  - Effect of endurance training and PGC-1α overexpression on calculated lactate

AB  - Lactate production is an important clue for understanding metabolic and signal 
      responses to exercise but its measurement is difficult. Therefore, this study aimed 
      (1) to develop a method of calculating lactate production volume during exercise 
      based on blood lactate concentration and compare the effects between endurance 
      exercise training (EX) and PGC-1α overexpression (OE), (2) to elucidate which 
      proteins and enzymes contribute to changes in lactate production due to EX and 
      muscle PGC-1α OE, and (3) to elucidate the relationship between lactate production 
      volume and signaling phosphorylations involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. EX and 
      PGC-1α OE decreased muscle lactate production volume at the absolute same-intensity 
      exercise, but only PGC-1α OE increased lactate production volume at the relative 
      same-intensity exercise. Multiple linear regression revealed that 
      phosphofructokinase, monocarboxylate transporter (MCT)1, MCT4, and citrate synthase 
      equally contribute to the lactate production volume at high-intensity exercise 
      within physiological adaptations, such as EX, not PGC-1α OE. We found that an 
      exercise intensity-dependent increase in the lactate production volume was 
      associated with a decrease in glycogen concentration and an increase in 
      P-AMPK/T-AMPK. This suggested that the calculated lactate production volume was 
      appropriate and reflected metabolic and signal responses but further modifications 
      are needed for the translation to humans.

AB  - Lipokines are bioactive compounds, derived from adipose tissue depots, that control 
      several molecular signaling pathways. Recently, 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic acid 
      (12,13-diHOME), an oxylipin, has gained prominence in the scientific literature. An 
      increase in circulating 12,13-diHOME has been associated with improved metabolic 
      health, and the action of this molecule appears to be mediated by brown adipose 
      tissue (BAT). Scientific evidence indicates that the increase in serum levels of 
      12,13-diHOME caused by stimuli such as physical exercise and exposure to cold may 
      favor the absorption of fatty acids by brown adipose tissue and stimulate the 
      browning process in white adipose tissue (WAT). Thus, strategies capable of 
      increasing 12,13-diHOME levels may be promising for the prevention and treatment of 
      obesity and metabolic diseases. This review explores the relationship of 
      12,13-diHOME with brown adipose tissue and its role in the metabolic health context, 
      as well as the signaling pathways involved between 12,13-diHOME and BAT.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite several studies on the effects of exercise training on 
      inflammatory biomarkers in patients with breast cancer, no earlier study has 
      systematically summarized their findings. Current systematic review and 
      meta-analysis has been done on earlier clinical trials in this topic. METHOD: 
      Relevant studies published up to August 2021 were searched through PubMed, MEDLINE, 
      SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Google Scholar using predefined keywords. Studies that examined 
      the effect of exercise training on inflammatory biomarkers in adult women with 
      breast cancer were included. RESULT: A total of 18 studies were included. Combining 
      11 effect sizes, exercise training significantly reduced CRP level (WMD: -0.55; 95% 
      CI: -1.10, -0.01). However, it had no significant influence on serum TNF-α (WMD: 
      -0.40; 95% CI: -1.30, 0.50) and IL-6 concentrations (WMD: -0.05, 95% CI: -0.53, 
      0.43) in 8 and 15 studies, respectively. Pooling 7 effect sizes, we failed to find 
      significant changes in IL-8 following exercise training (WMD: -0.65, 95% CI: -1.57, 
      0.28). Moreover, we reached no significant findings for serum levels of INF-ɣ (WMD: 
      -2.66, 95% CI: -7.67, 2.36), IL-1β (WMD: 0.03, 95% CI: -0.26, 0.21), and IL-10 (WMD: 
      -0.70, 95% CI: -2.92, 1.52). Based on subgroup analyses, best findings were reached 
      in long-term intervention and after concurrent training. DISCUSSION: Chronic 
      inflammation is hypothesized to be associated with breast cancer development. We 
      found significant reduction in CRP level following exercise training, which was more 
      considerable after concurrent aerobic and resistance training and in long-term 
      intervention. No significant changes were seen in serum levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, 
      IL-10, INF-ɣ, IL-1β following exercise training. Further studies are needed to find 
      more details.

TI  - A Sports Nutrition Perspective on the Impacts of Hypoxic High-Intensity Interval 
      Training (HIIT) on Appetite Regulatory Mechanisms: A Narrative Review of the Current 
      Evidence.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19031736 [doi]
LID - 1736
AB  - High-intensity interval training (HIIT) and low-oxygen exposure may inhibit the 
      secretion of appetite-stimulating hormones, suppress appetite, and inhibit dietary 
      intake. Physiological changes affecting appetite are frequent and include appetite 
      hormone (ghrelin, leptin, PYY, and GLP-1) effects and the subjective loss of 
      appetite, resulting in nutritional deficiencies. This paper is a narrative review of 
      the literature to verify the HIIT effect on appetite regulation mechanisms and 
      discusses the possible relationship between appetite effects and the need for 
      high-intensity exercise training in a hypoxic environment. We searched 
      MEDLINE/PubMed and the Web of Science databases, as well as English articles (gray 
      literature by Google Scholar for English articles) through Google Scholar, and the 
      searched studies primarily focused on the acute effects of exercise and hypoxic 
      environmental factors on appetite, related hormones, and energy intake. In a general 
      normoxic environment, regular exercise habits may have accustomed the athlete to 
      intense training and, therefore, no changes occurred in their subjective appetite, 
      but there is a significant effect on the appetite hormones. The higher the exercise 
      intensity and the longer the duration, the more likely exercise is to cause 
      exercise-induced appetite loss and changes in appetite hormones. It has not been 
      clear whether performing HIIT in a hypoxic environment may interfere with the 
      exerciser's diet or the nutritional supplement intake as it suppresses appetite, 
      which, in turn, affects and interferes with the recovery efficiency after exercise. 
      Although appetite-regulatory hormones, the subjective appetite, and energy intake 
      may be affected by exercise, such as hypoxia or hypoxic exercise, we believe that 
      energy intake should be the main observable indicator in future studies on 
      environmental and exercise interventions.

TI  - Cheese Ingestion Increases Muscle Protein Synthesis Rates Both at Rest and During 
      Recovery from Exercise in Healthy, Young Males: A Randomized Parallel-group Trial.
LID - nxac007 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jn/nxac007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Protein ingestion increases muscle protein synthesis rates. The food 
      matrix in which protein is provided can strongly modulate the postprandial muscle 
      protein synthetic response. So far, the muscle protein synthetic response to the 
      ingestion of whole foods remains largely unexplored. OBJECTIVES: To compare the 
      impact of ingesting 30g protein provided as milk protein or cheese on postprandial 
      plasma amino acid concentrations and muscle protein synthesis rates at rest and 
      during recovery from exercise in vivo in young males. METHODS: In this randomized, 
      parallel-group intervention trial, twenty healthy, 18-35y old males ingested 
      30g protein provided as cheese or milk protein concentrate following a single-legged 
      resistance-type exercise session consisting of 12 sets of leg press and leg 
      extension exercise. Primed, continuous intravenous L-[ring-13C6]-phenylalanine 
      infusions were combined with the collection of blood and muscle tissue samples to 
      assess postabsorptive and 4h postprandial muscle protein synthesis rates at rest and 
      during recovery from exercise. Data were analyzed using repeated measures 
      Time × Group (× Leg) ANOVA. RESULTS: Plasma total amino acid concentrations 
      increased after protein ingestion (Time: P < 0.001), with 38% higher peak 
      concentrations following milk protein than cheese ingestion (Time x Group: 
      P < 0.001). Muscle protein synthesis rates increased following both cheese and milk 
      protein ingestion from 0.037 ± 0.014 to 0.055 ± 0.018%·h-1 and 0.034 ± 0.008 to 
      0.056 ± 0.010%·h-1 at rest and even more following exercise from 0.031 ± 0.010 to 
      0.067 ± 0.013%·h-1 and 0.030 ± 0.008 to 0.063 ± 0.010%·h-1, respectively (Time: all 
      P < 0.05; Time × Leg: P = 0.002), with no differences between cheese and milk 
      protein ingestion (Time x Group: both P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Cheese ingestion 
      increases muscle protein synthesis rates both at rest and during recovery from 
      exercise. The postprandial muscle protein synthetic response to the ingestion of 
      cheese or milk protein does not differ when 30g protein are ingested at rest or 
      during recovery from exercise in healthy, young males. This trial was registered at 
      www.trialregister.nl as NL7941 (https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/7941).

AB  - With the rapid development of the Internet of Things, 5G, and communication 
      technologies, the growth of various types of data has shown an exponential trend. 
      Edge computing technology provides users with almost unlimited computing power 
      through a large number of high-performance servers in the data center. It is one of 
      the important solutions for big data analysis and processing. Volleyball has caused 
      a great wave in China as early as the 1960s, but people pay little attention to the 
      physical quality of volleyball players. At the same time, in the medical field, it 
      is difficult to give a clear value to the athlete's protein requirement. Therefore, 
      this article aims to observe the specific values of protein metabolism in volleyball 
      at different levels of protein nutrition. By designing controlled experiments, then 
      these rats under three nutrient levels of protein were observed and protein 
      metabolism was analyzed after volleyball. The results of the study show that 
      volleyball exercise can reduce the nitrogen balance and gastrocnemius nitrogen 
      content. The nitrogen balance of the 17% group decreased from 388 mg/day before 
      exercise to 336 mg/day, and the gastrocnemius nitrogen content decreased by up to 
      5.2%; serum urea nitrogen concentration and liver nitrogen content are increased, 
      indicating the enhancement of protein catabolism. Different protein nutrition levels 
      have different effects on protein metabolism during volleyball. The protein intake 
      level of 17% is more conducive to resist the protein decomposition caused by 
      volleyball. It can be seen that, based on edge computing technology, the influence 
      factors of protein nutrition level on protein metabolism during volleyball sports 
      can be well explored, and the research results are also very valuable.

TI  - Passing on the exercise baton: What can endocrine patients learn from elite 
      athletes?
LID - 10.1111/cen.14683 [doi]
AB  - As elite athletes demonstrate through the Olympic motto 'Citius, Altius, Fortius- 
      Communiter', new performance records are driven forward by favourable skeletal 
      muscle bioenergetics, cardiorespiratory, and endocrine system adaptations. At a 
      recreational level, regular physical activity is an effective nonpharmacological 
      therapy in the treatment of many endocrine conditions. However, the impact of 
      physical exercise on endocrine function and how best to incorporate exercise therapy 
      into clinical care are not well understood. Beyond the pursuit of an Olympic medal, 
      elite athletes may therefore serve as role models for showcasing how exercise can 
      help in the management of endocrine disorders and improve metabolic dysfunction. 
      This review summarizes research evidence for clinicians who wish to understand 
      endocrine changes in athletes who already perform high levels of activity as well as 
      to encourage patients to exercise more safely. Herein, we detail the upper limits of 
      athleticism to showcase the adaptability of human endocrine-metabolic-physiological 
      systems. Then, we describe the growing research base that advocates the importance 
      of understanding maladaptation to physical training and nutrition in males and 
      females; especially the young. Finally, we explore the impact of physical activity 
      in improving some endocrine disorders with guidance on how lessons can be taken from 
      athletes training and incorporated into strategies to move more people more often.

TI  - Prehabilitation, enhanced recovery after surgery, or both? A narrative review.
LID - S0007-0912(21)00795-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.bja.2021.12.007 [doi]
AB  - This narrative review presents a biological rationale and evidence to describe how 
      the preoperative condition of the patient contributes to postoperative morbidity. 
      Any preoperative condition that prevents a patient from tolerating the physiological 
      stress of surgery (e.g. poor cardiopulmonary reserve, sarcopaenia), impairs the 
      stress response (e.g. malnutrition, frailty), and/or augments the catabolic response 
      to stress (e.g. insulin resistance) is a risk factor for poor surgical outcomes. 
      Prehabilitation interventions that include exercise, nutrition, and psychosocial 
      components can be applied before surgery to strengthen physiological reserve and 
      enhance functional capacity, which, in turn, supports recovery through attaining 
      surgical resilience. Prehabilitation complements Enhanced Recovery After Surgery 
      (ERAS) care to achieve optimal patient outcomes because recovery is not a passive 
      process and it begins preoperatively.

      following day in postmenopausal women: a randomized cross-over study.
PG  - 175-184
LID - 10.1080/02640414.2021.1982497 [doi]
AB  - High-sugar consumption is related to dyslipidemia. How acute exercise affects 
      postprandial lipid and lipoprotein particle responses to a high-sugar meal (HSM) in 
      postmenopausal women is unclear. We examined the effects of a late afternoon/early 
      evening bout of aerobic exercise on postprandial lipid and lipoprotein particle 
      responses to a HSM breakfast the following day in 22 postmenopausal women. Subjects 
      underwent exercise (EX) and no exercise (NE) conditions in the evening 13-16 h 
      before the HSM breakfast consumption, in a random order. During the EX condition, 
      subjects performed supervised aerobic exercise for 60 min at 75% of age-predicted 
      maximum heart rate. The HSM (75.6% carbohydrate and 33% energy needs) was consumed 
      after a 12-h fast. Serum lipids and lipoproteins were assessed at baseline and 
      postprandially (60, 120, 180 min). Repeated measures analysis showed significantly 
      lower area under the curve (geometric means [95% CI]) for triglycerides (TG) 
      (2.96[2.43, 3.61] vs. 3.24[2.70, 3.88] mmol/L*hr; p = 0.049) and very low density 
      lipoprotein particles (VLDLP) (114.6[88.2, 148.9] vs. 134.3[108.1, 166.9] nmol/L*hr; 
      p = 0.02) during the EX versus NE condition. There were no condition effects for 
      other variables. In conclusion, the EX versus NE condition lowered postprandial AUC 
      for TG and VLDLP following HSM consumption in postmenopausal women.Trial

TI  - Eight weeks of combined exercise training do not alter circulating microRNAs-29a, 
      -133a, -133b, and -155 in young, healthy men.
LID - 10.1007/s00421-022-04886-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Individuals with a family history of type 2 diabetes (FH +) have an 
      increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have 
      been implicated as biomarkers of type 2 diabetes risk. Here, we investigated if four 
      circulating miRNAs related to glucose metabolism were altered in men with a FH + and 
      we conducted a preliminary analysis to determine if miRNA expressions were 
      responsive to 8 weeks of combined exercise training. METHODS: Sixteen young healthy 
      men (mean ± SD; age 22.5 ± 2.5; BMI 26.4 ± 4.0) with FH + or without a family 
      history of type 2 diabetes (FH -) underweight 8 weeks of combined endurance and 
      resistance exercise training (n = 8 FH -; n = 8 FH +). The expression of miR-29a, 
      miR-133a, miR-133b, and miR-155 were measured in serum before and after exercise 
      training. QIAGEN's Ingenuity(®) Pathway Analysis was used to examine miRNA target 
      genes and their involvement in glucose metabolism signaling pathways. RESULTS: There 
      were no differences in miRNA expressions between FH - and FH + . Exercise training 
      did not alter miRNA expressions in either FH - or FH + despite improvements in 
      insulin sensitivity, aerobic capacity, and muscular strength. miR-29a and miR-155 
      were inversely related to fasting glucose, and miR-133a and miR-133b were negatively 
      correlated with glucose tolerance; however, correlations were not observed with 
      insulin sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: The circulating miRNAs- miR-29a, miR-133a, 
      miR-133b, and miR-155 are related to measures of glucose metabolism in healthy, 
      normoglycemic men, but do not reflect peripheral insulin sensitivity or improvements 
      in metabolic health following 8 weeks of combined exercise training.

TI  - Prehabilitation in rectal surgery: a narrative review.
PG  - 293-299
LID - 10.1007/s00384-021-04092-5 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACRT) can make decompensated patients more 
      vulnerable prior to rectal surgery. Prehabilitation is an intervention which 
      enhances functional capacity to withstand the stress of surgery. The aim of this 
      review was to evaluate the impact of prehabilitation for patients undergoing rectal 
      surgery on physical fitness and clinical outcomes and to establish feasibility of 
      prehabilitation. METHODS: An analysis of the literature was conducted of PubMed, the 
      Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and ScienceDirect. Articles were initially 
      included based on their title and abstracts reviewed. Full-text copies of those 
      selected were obtained for confirmation of inclusion. RESULTS: Eight studies were 
      included. Heterogenicity was observed in the structure of exercise programmes. 
      Improvements in physical fitness were observed in six studies. One study 
      demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in quality of life. The 
      prehabilitation programmes were shown to be feasible, with high completion rates. No 
      adverse events were reported. There was limited data regarding the impact of 
      prehabilitation on postoperative outcomes. CONCLUSION: Current evidence on 
      prehabilitation in rectal surgery has considerable heterogenicity in both structure 
      of programmes and outcome measures. Standardisation is required for future 
      evaluation of the impact on outcomes. A trimodal approach of exercise, nutritional 
      and psychological interventions has been employed in similar programmes, and should 
      be used in rectal surgery. The intervention should be tailored to the patient and 
      environment. This review highlights the benefits, safety and feasibility of 
      prehabilitation and provides a platform for consensus-building for international 
      trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A review of current practices of educational interventions for lifestyle 
      medicine was performed to inform the design of interventions with long-term goals of 
      improving patient outcomes. METHODS: Systematic review of PubMed, MedEdPORTAL, and 
      Cochrane using keywords "lifestyle medicine," "education," "medical students," and 
      "medical school" was done by 3 independent reviewers. Location, learner, curricular 
      hours, focus, outcomes, and impact are reported. RESULTS: Of 452 identified 
      citations, 32 met criteria. Most studies (81%) were conducted in the U.S. and 
      designed for medical students (72%). Studies focused primarily on nutrition (78%) 
      and exercise (59%). Curricula were delivered on average across 13.7 h. Lectures were 
      used in 53% of papers. The outcomes most commonly studied were satisfaction (66%,), 
      knowledge perception (66%), and reported clinical practices (34%). Intervention 
      impact at level 2b (31%) and level 3 (34%) were most common. CONCLUSION: Medical 
      educators looking to integrate lifestyle education curriculum should consider 
      current resources as a starting point, especially ones with higher outcome 
      measurements. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Novel interventions should target lifestyle 
      medicine competencies with equitable distribution among learners using active 
      learning approaches. The authors propose initial efforts focusing on instruction of 
      clinical educators and practicing physicians, with advocacy for increased 
      reimbursement.

AB  - Skeletal muscle wasting has been well-documented among hemodialysis patients. This 
      catabolic condition can be induced by numerous factors, including low-grade 
      inflammation, and is associated with impairments in functional capacity and quality 
      of life, as well as an increased mortality risk. We previously showed that 12 weeks 
      of intradialytic resistance training increases lean mass, functional capacity, and 
      the quality of life of hemodialysis patients. This chapter provides the details of a 
      protocol of intradialytic exercise that leads to improvements in inflammatory 
      status, body composition, and functional capacity.

AB  - Aging induces alterations in bone structure and strength through a multitude of 
      processes, exacerbating common aging- related diseases like osteoporosis and 
      osteoarthritis. Cellular hallmarks of aging are examined, as related to bone and the 
      marrow microenvironment, and ways in which these might contribute to a variety of 
      age-related perturbations in osteoblasts, osteocytes, marrow adipocytes, 
      chondrocytes, osteoclasts, and their respective progenitors. Cellular senescence, 
      stem cell exhaustion, mitochondrial dysfunction, epigenetic and intracellular 
      communication changes are central pathways and recognized as associated and 
      potentially causal in aging. We focus on these in musculoskeletal system and 
      highlight knowledge gaps in the literature regarding cellular and tissue crosstalk 
      in bone, cartilage, and the bone marrow niche. While senolytics have been utilized 
      to target aging pathways, here we propose non-pharmacologic, exercise-based 
      interventions as prospective "senolytics" against aging effects on the skeleton. 
      Increased bone mass and delayed onset or progression of osteoporosis and 
      osteoarthritis are some of the recognized benefits of regular exercise across the 
      lifespan. Further investigation is needed to delineate how cellular indicators of 
      aging manifest in bone and the marrow niche and how altered cellular and tissue 
      crosstalk impact disease progression, as well as consideration of exercise as a 
      therapeutic modality, as a means to enhance discovery of bone-targeted therapies.

TI  - Time-restricted feeding combined with aerobic exercise training can prevent weight 
      gain and improve metabolic disorders in mice fed a high-fat diet.
PG  - 797-813
LID - 10.1113/JP280820 [doi]
AB  - KEY POINTS: Time-restricted feeding (TRF, in which energy intake is restricted to 
      8 h/day during the dark phase) alone or combined with aerobic exercise (AE) training 
      can prevent weight gain and metabolic disorders in Swiss mice fed a high-fat diet. 
      The benefits of TRF combined with AE are associated with improved hepatic metabolism 
      and decreased hepatic lipid accumulation. TRF combined with AE training increased 
      fatty acid oxidation and decreased expression of lipogenic and gluconeogenic genes 
      in the liver of young male Swiss mice. TRF combined with AE training attenuated the 
      detrimental effects of high-fat diet feeding on the insulin signalling pathway in 
      the liver. ABSTRACT: Time-restricted feeding (TRF) or physical exercise have been 
      shown to be efficient in the prevention and treatment of metabolic disorders; 
      however, the additive effects of TRF combined with aerobic exercise (AE) training on 
      liver metabolism have not been widely explored. In this study TRF (8 h in the active 
      phase) and TRF combined with AE (TRF+Exe) were compared in male Swiss mice fed a 
      high-fat diet, with evaluation of the effects on insulin sensitivity and expression 
      of hepatic genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis. 
      As in previous reports, we show that TRF alone (eating only between zeitgeber time 
      16 and 0) was sufficient to reduce weight and adiposity gain, increase fatty acid 
      oxidation and decrease lipogenesis genes in the liver. In addition, we show that 
      mice of the TRF+Exe group showed additional adaptations such as increased oxygen 
      consumption ( V̇O2 ), carbon dioxide production ( V̇CO2 ) and production of ketone 
      bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate). Also, TRF+Exe attenuated the negative effects of 
      high-fat diet feeding on the insulin signalling pathway (insulin receptor, insulin 
      receptor substrate, Akt), and led to increased fatty acid oxidation (Ppara, Cpt1a) 
      and decreased gluconeogenic (Fbp1, Pck1, Pgc1a) and lipogenic (Srebp1c, Cd36) gene 
      expression in the liver. These molecular results were accompanied by increased 
      glucose metabolism, lower serum triglycerides and reduced hepatic lipid content in 
      the TRF+Exe group. The data presented in this study show that TRF alone has benefits 
      but TRF+Exe has additive benefits and can mitigate the harmful effects of consuming 
      a high-fat diet on body adiposity, liver metabolism and glycaemic homeostasis in 
      young male Swiss mice.

      50% and 90% peak heart rate plus an additional 350 kcal shake fed after exercise to 
      match energy availability between groups). Weight-related QoL (Laval Questionnaire) 
      as well as oxidized (POVPC, HOOA-PC, HPETE-PC, HETE-PC, PEIPC, KOOA-PC) and 
      non-oxidized (PAPC and lysoPC) phospholipids were assessed pre- and 
      post-intervention. Fitness (VO(2)peak), body composition (BodPod), and clinical 
      bloods were also tested. LCD+INT significantly increased VO(2)peak (mL/kg/min, 
      P = 0.03) compared to LCD despite similar fat loss, blood glucose, insulin 
      sensitivity, and inflammatory responses. LCD+INT had significantly greater increases 
      in QoL sexual life domain (P = 0.05) and tended to have a greater increase in the 
      emotions domain (P = 0.09) and total score (P = 0.10) compared to LCD. There were no 
      significant differences between treatments for changes in phospholipids despite 
      LCD+INT increasing measured oxidized and non-oxidized phospholipids while LCD 
      decreased POVPC, HOOA-PC, and PEIPC as well as non-oxidized PAPC and lysoPC. 
      Interestingly, the rise in PEIPC correlated with elevated VO(2)peak (mL/kg/min 
      r = 0.42, P = 0.05). Decreased caloric intake was, however, linked to a decrease in 
      PAPC (r = 0.53, P = 0.01), lysoPC (r = 0.52, P = 0.02), POVPC (r = 0.43, P = 0.05), 
      and HPETE-PC (r = 0.43, P = 0.05). The decrease in HETE-PC also correlated with 
      increases in the QoL domains symptoms (r = -0.46, P = 0.04), hygiene/clothing 
      (r = -0.53, P = 0.01), emotions (r = -0.53, P = 0.01), social interactions 
      (r = -0.49, P = 0.02), and total score (r = -0.52, P = 0.02). In conclusion, 
      although LCD and LCD+INT improved weight related QoL over 13 days in females with 
      obesity, LCD+INT tended to improve sexual life, emotions as well as total QoL score 
      more than LCD. These data suggest caloric restriction and fitness may act through 
      different mechanisms to support QoL.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sexual and gender minority (SGM) adults experience significant 
      cardiovascular health disparities, yet little is known about diet and food 
      insecurity in this population. This review summarizes recent literature on diet and 
      food insecurity in SGM adults and their contribution to cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
      risk in this population. RECENT FINDINGS: Existing evidence on diet and food 
      insecurity disparities among SGM adults is inconclusive and research examining their 
      link with CVD risk in SGM adults is limited. The majority of existing studies lack 
      standardized and validated assessments of diet and food insecurity. Correlates of 
      unhealthy diet and food insecurity among SGM adults are poorly understood. Research 
      examining the associations between diet and food insecurity with CVD risk in SGM 
      adults is limited. Longitudinal studies are needed to investigate whether diet and 
      food insecurity contribute to the cardiovascular health disparities observed in SGM 
      adults.

TI  - Increased use of knowledge translation strategies is associated with greater 
      research impact on public health policy and practice: an analysis of trials of 
      nutrition, physical activity, sexual health, tobacco, alcohol and substance use 
      interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Greater use of knowledge translation (KT) strategies is recommended to 
      improve the research impact of public health trials. The purpose of this study was 
      to describe (1) the research impact of setting-based public health intervention 
      trials on public health policy and practice; (2) the association between 
      characteristics of trials and their research impact on public health policy and 
      practice; and (3) the association between the use of KT strategies and research 
      impacts on public health policy and practice. METHODS: We conducted a survey of 
      authors of intervention trials targeting nutrition, physical activity, sexual 
      health, tobacco, alcohol or substance use. We assessed the use of KT strategies 
      aligned to domains of the Knowledge-To-Action Framework. We defined "research 
      impact" on health policy and practice as any one or more of the following: citation 
      in policy documents or announcements, government reports, training materials, 
      guidelines, textbooks or court rulings; or endorsement by a (non)governmental 
      organization; use in policy or practice decision-making; or use in the development 
      of a commercial resource or service. RESULTS: Of the included trials, the authors 
      reported that 65% had one or more research impacts. The most frequently reported 
      research impact was citation in a policy document or announcement (46%). There were 
      no significant associations between the effectiveness of the intervention, trial 
      risk of bias, setting or health risk and trial impact. However, for every one unit 
      increase in the total KT score (range 0-8), reflecting greater total KT activity, 
      the odds of a health policy or practice research impact increased by approximately 
      30% (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.66; p = 0.031). Post hoc examination of KT domain 
      scores suggests that KT actions focused on providing tailored support to facilitate 
      program implementation and greater use of research products and tools to disseminate 
      findings to end-users may be most influential in achieving impact. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Trials of public health interventions frequently have public health impacts, and the 
      use of more comprehensive KT strategies may facilitate greater research impact.

TI  - Differences in Left Ventricular Function at Rest and during Isometric Handgrip 
      Exercise in Elite Aquatic Sport Athletes.
PG  - 507-516
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000002812 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Elite swimmers (Sw) have lower diastolic function compared with elite 
      runners, possibly as an adaptation to the aquatic training environment. Water polo 
      players (WP) and artistic swimmers (AS) are exposed to the same hydrostatic 
      pressures as Sw, but they are subject to different training intensities, postures, 
      and hemodynamic stressors. Our purpose was to compare resting and exercising cardiac 
      function in elite Sw, WP, and AS, to characterize the influence of training for 
      aquatic sport on left ventricular (LV) adaptation. METHODS: Ninety athletes (Sw, 
      20M/17F; WP, 21M/9F; AS, 23F) at the 2019 Fédération Internationale de Natation 
      World Championships volunteered for resting and stress (3 min 30% maximal isometric 
      handgrip) echocardiographic assessment of LV global function and mechanics. RESULTS: 
      Male Sw displayed greater resting systolic and diastolic function compared with WP; 
      however, both groups maintained stroke volume under high-pressure handgrip stress 
      (Sw, ∆-4% ± 12%; WP, ∆-1% ± 13%, P = 0.11). There were no differences between female 
      Sw and WP resting LV function, but Sw demonstrated greater function over AS. During 
      isometric handgrip, all female sport athletes maintained stroke volume (Sw, ∆3% ± 
      16%; WP, ∆-10% ± 11%; AS, ∆-2% ± 14%, P = 0.46), but WP had improved apical rotation 
      (∆1.7° ± 4.5°), which was reduced in AS (∆-3.1° ± 4.5°) and maintained in Sw (∆-0.5° 
      ± 3.8°, P = 0.04). Unlike Sw and WP, AS displayed a unique maintenance of early 
      filling velocity during handgrip exercise (Sw, ∆-3.5 ± 14.7 cm·s-1; WP, ∆-15.1 ± 
      10.8 cm·s-1; AS, ∆1.5 ± 15.3 cm·s-1, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Among male athletes, Sw 
      display primarily volume-based functional adaptations distinct from the mixed 
      volume-pressure adaptations of WP; however, both groups can maintain stroke volume 
      with increased afterload. Female Sw and WP do not demonstrate sport-specific 
      differences like males, perhaps owing to sex differences in adaptation, but have 
      greater volume-based adaptations than AS. Lastly, AS display unique functional 
      adaptations that may be driven by elevated pressures under low-volume conditions.

      comprehensive review.
PG  - 299-322
LID - 10.1002/ptr.7312 [doi]
AB  - Phytosterols (PSs), classified into plant sterols and stanols, are bioactive 
      compounds found in foods of plant origin. PSs have been proposed to exert a wide 
      number of pharmacological properties, including the potential to reduce total and 
      low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and thereby decreasing the risk of 
      cardiovascular diseases. Other health-promoting effects of PSs include anti-obesity, 
      anti-diabetic, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. 
      Also, anticancer effects have been strongly suggested, as phytosterol-rich diets may 
      reduce the risk of cancer by 20%. The aim of this review is to provide a general 
      overview of the available evidence regarding the beneficial physiological and 
      pharmacological activities of PSs, with special emphasis on their therapeutic 
      potential for human health and safety. Also, we will explore the factors that 
      influence the physiologic response to PSs.

TI  - Overweight and cystic fibrosis: An unexpected challenge.
PG  - S40-S49
LID - 10.1002/ppul.25748 [doi]
AB  - Achieving a healthy weight balance has been a central focus of care for people who 
      have cystic fibrosis (CF). Over the years, the emphasis has primarily been on 
      promoting weight gain to optimize pulmonary outcomes. With continued improvements in 
      CF care, including highly effective CF modulators available for many people, the CF 
      community is now experiencing a new challenge: addressing the concern that some 
      people are gaining weight excessively. While at this time, we do not know to what 
      extent overweight and obesity will affect health outcomes for people with CF, it is 
      likely that excessive weight gain may have negative health impacts similar to those 
      seen in the general population. In this paper, we review the history of nutritional 
      guidelines for people with CF, as well as more recent trends toward overweight and 
      obesity for some. A multidisciplinary approach is needed to collaboratively start 
      the oftentimes difficult conversation regarding excessive weight gain, and to 
      identify resources to help people achieve and maintain a healthy weight through 
      diet, exercise, and behavioral modification.

TI  - Acute exercise rapidly activates hepatic mitophagic flux.
LID - 10.1152/japplphysiol.00704.2021 [doi]
AB  - Exercise is critical for improving metabolic health and putatively maintains or 
      enhances mitochondrial quality control in metabolic tissues. While previous work has 
      shown exercise elicits hepatic mitochondrial biogenesis, it is unknown if acute 
      exercise activates hepatic mitophagy, the selective degradation of damaged or 
      low-functioning mitochondria. We tested if an acute bout of treadmill running 
      increased hepatic mitophagic flux both immediately after and 2 hours post-exercise 
      in 15-24-week-old C57BL/6J female mice. Acute exercise did not significantly 
      increase markers of autophagic flux, however, mitophagic flux was activated 2 hours 
      post-treadmill running as measured by accumulation of both LC3-II and p62 in 
      isolated mitochondria in the presence of leupeptin, an inhibitor of autophagosome 
      degradation. Further, mitochondrial associated ubiquitin, which recruits the 
      autophagy receptor protein p62, was also significantly increased at 2 hours. Further 
      examination via western blot and proteomics analysis revealed acute exercise elicits 
      a time-dependent, dynamic activation of mitophagy pathways. Moreover, the results 
      suggest that exercise induced hepatic mitophagy is likely mediated by both 
      poly-ubiquitination and receptor mediated signaling pathways. Overall, we provide 
      evidence that acute exercise activates hepatic mitophagic flux while also revealing 
      specific receptor-mediated proteins by which exercise maintains mitochondrial 
      quality control in the liver.

TI  - A Life History Perspective on Athletes with Low Energy Availability.
LID - 10.1007/s40279-022-01643-w [doi]
AB  - The energy costs of athletic training can be substantial, and deficits arising from 
      costs unmet by adequate energy intake, leading to a state of low energy 
      availability, may adversely impact athlete health and performance. Life history 
      theory is a branch of evolutionary theory that recognizes that the way the body uses 
      energy-and responds to low energy availability-is an evolved trait. Energy is a 
      finite resource that must be distributed throughout the body to simultaneously fuel 
      all biological processes. When energy availability is low, insufficient energy may 
      be available to equally support all processes. As energy used for one function 
      cannot be used for others, energetic "trade-offs" will arise. Biological processes 
      offering the greatest immediate survival value will be protected, even if this 
      results in energy being diverted away from others, potentially leading to their 
      downregulation. Athletes with low energy availability provide a useful model for 
      anthropologists investigating the biological trade-offs that occur when energy is 
      scarce, while the broader conceptual framework provided by life history theory may 
      be useful to sport and exercise researchers who investigate the influence of low 
      energy availability on athlete health and performance. The goals of this review are: 
      (1) to describe the core tenets of life history theory; (2) consider trade-offs that 
      might occur in athletes with low energy availability in the context of four broad 
      biological areas: reproduction, somatic maintenance, growth, and immunity; and (3) 
      use this evolutionary perspective to consider potential directions for future 
      research.

AB  - The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shocked world health 
      authorities generating a global health crisis. The present study aimed to analyze 
      the different factors associated with physical activity that could have an impact in 
      the COVID-19, providing a practical recommendation based on actual scientific 
      knowledge. We conducted a consensus critical review using primary sources, 
      scientific articles, and secondary bibliographic indexes, databases, and web pages. 
      The method was a narrative literature review of the available literature regarding 
      physical activity and physical activity related factors during the COVID-19 
      pandemic. The main online database used in the present research were PubMed, SciELO, 
      and Google Scholar. COVID-19 has negatively influenced motor behavior, levels of 
      regular exercise practice, eating and nutritional patterns, and the psychological 
      status of citizens. These factors feed into each other, worsening COVID-19 symptoms, 
      the risk of death from SARS-CoV-2, and the symptoms and effectiveness of the 
      vaccine. The characteristics and symptoms related with the actual COVID-19 pandemic 
      made the physical activity interventions a valuable prevention and treatment factor. 
      Physical activity improves body composition, the cardiorespiratory, metabolic, and 
      mental health of patients and enhancing antibody responses in vaccination.

LID - 10.1111/acel.13527 [doi]
LID - e13527
AB  - There are functional benefits to exercise in muscle, even when performed late in 
      life, but the contributions of epigenetic factors to late-life exercise adaptation 
      are poorly defined. Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), 
      ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and mitochondrial-specific examination of methylation, targeted 
      high-resolution methylation analysis, and DNAge™ epigenetic aging clock analysis 
      with a translatable model of voluntary murine endurance/resistance exercise training 
      (progressive weighted wheel running, PoWeR), we provide evidence that exercise may 
      mitigate epigenetic aging in skeletal muscle. Late-life PoWeR from 22-24 months of 
      age modestly but significantly attenuates an age-associated shift toward promoter 
      hypermethylation. The epigenetic age of muscle from old mice that PoWeR-trained for 
      eight weeks was approximately eight weeks younger than 24-month-old sedentary 
      counterparts, which represents ~8% of the expected murine lifespan. These data 
      provide a molecular basis for exercise as a therapy to attenuate skeletal muscle 
      aging.

TI  - Exercise increases phosphorylation of the putative mTORC2 activity readout NDRG1 in 
      human skeletal muscle.
PG  - E63-E73

AB  - In mice, exercise is suggested to activate the mechanistic target of rapamycin 
      complex 2 (mTORC2) in skeletal muscle, and mTORC2 is required for normal muscle 
      glucose uptake during exercise. Whether this translates to human skeletal muscle and 
      what signaling pathways facilitate the exercise-induced mTORC2 activation is 
      unknown. We herein tested the hypothesis that exercise increases mTORC2 activity in 
      human skeletal muscle and investigated if β(2)-adrenergic receptor (AR) activation 
      mediates exercise-induced mTORC2 activation. We examined several mTORC2 activity 
      readouts (p-NDRG1 Thr346, p-Akt Ser473, p-mTOR S2481, and p-Akt Thr450) in human 
      skeletal muscle biopsies after uphill walking or cycling exercise. In mouse muscles, 
      we assessed mTORC2 activity readouts following acute activation of muscle 
      β(2)-adrenergic or G(S) signaling and during in vivo and ex vivo muscle 
      contractions. Exercise increased phosphorylation of NDRG1 Thr346 in human soleus, 
      gastrocnemius, and vastus lateralis muscle, without changing p-Akt Ser473, p-Akt 
      Thr450, and p-mTOR Ser2481. In mouse muscle, stimulation of β(2)-adrenergic or G(S) 
      signaling and ex vivo contractions failed to increase p-NDRG1 Thr346, whereas in 
      vivo contractions were sufficient to induce p-NDRG1 Thr346. In conclusion, the 
      mTORC2 activity readout p-NDRG1 Thr346 is a novel exercise-responsive signaling 
      protein in human skeletal muscle. Notably, contraction-induced p-NDRG1 Thr346 
      appears to require a systemic factor. Unlike exercise, and in contrast to published 
      data obtained in cultured muscles cells, stimulation of β(2)-adrenergic signaling is 
      not sufficient to trigger NDRG1 phosphorylation in mature mouse skeletal muscle.NEW 
      & NOTEWORTHY The mTORC2 readout p-NDRG Thr346 is a novel exercise-responsive protein 
      in human skeletal muscle. β2-AR and G(S) signaling are not sufficient to induce 
      mTORC2 signaling in adult muscle. In vivo, but not ex vivo, contraction induced 
      p-NDRG Thr346, which indicates requirement of a systemic factor for exercise-induced 
      mTORC2 activation.

TI  - Biceps femoris long head sarcomere and fascicle length adaptations after 3 weeks of 
      eccentric exercise training.
PG  - 43-49

AB  - BACKGROUND: Eccentric exercise increases muscle fascicle lengths; however, the 
      mechanisms behind this adaptation are still unknown. This study aimed to determine 
      whether biceps femoris long head (BFlh) fascicle length increases in response to 3 
      weeks of eccentric exercise training are the result of an in-series addition of 
      sarcomeres within the muscle fibers. METHODS: Ten recreationally active participants 
      (age = 27 ± 3 years; mass = 70 ± 14 kg; height = 174 ± 9 cm; mean ± SD) completed 3 
      weeks of Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE) training on a custom exercise device that 
      was instrumented with load cells. We collected in vivo sarcomere and muscle fascicle 
      images of the BFlh in 2 regions (central and distal) by using microendoscopy and 3 
      dimension ultrasonography. We then estimated sarcomere length, sarcomere number, and 
      fascicle length before and after the training intervention. RESULTS: Eccentric knee 
      flexion strength increased after the training (15%; p < 0.001; η(p)(2) = 0.75). 
      Further, we found a significant increase in fascicle length (21%; p < 0.001; 
      η(p)(2) = 0.81) and sarcomere length (17%; p < 0.001; η(p)(2) = 0.90) in the distal 
      but not in the central portion of the muscle. The estimated number of sarcomeres in 
      series did not change in either region. CONCLUSION: Fascicle length adaptations 
      appear to be heterogeneous in the BFlh in response to 3 weeks of NHE training. An 
      increase in sarcomere length, rather than the addition of sarcomeres in series, 
      appears to underlie increases in fascicle length in the distal region of the BFlh. 
      The mechanism driving regional increases in fascicle and sarcomere length remains 
      unknown, but we speculate that it may be driven by regional changes in the passive 
      tension of muscle or connective tissue adaptations.

AB  - The present study examined the effect of the isocaloric low-carbohydrate ketogenic 
      diet (LCKD) with or without exercise training for 6 weeks on postpartum weight 
      retention (PPWR), body composition, metabolic profile and physical activity 
      performance in postpartum mice. Postpartum mice were assigned to four groups 
      (n=8/group) as follows: (1) those on a control diet without aerobic exercise (CN); 
      (2) those on a control diet with aerobic exercise (CN+EX), (3); those on a LCKD 
      without aerobic exercise (LCKD); (4) those on a LCKD with aerobic exercise 
      (LCKD+EX). CN+EX and LCKD+EX mice performed 6 weeks of exercise training on a 
      treadmill. After the 6-week intervention, physical activity performance was 
      determined. Postpartum mice in all groups experienced progressive reductions in body 
      weight over the study period. The LCKD group had the smallest reduction in PPWR 
      (P<.05). The LCKD group had significantly higher total cholesterol, low-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol and lactate dehydrogenase levels, and liver lipid 
      concentrations with a worsened glucose tolerance, compared to the CN group (P<.05). 
      The LCKD group showed significant reductions in physical activity performance, 
      whilst the LCKD+EX group showed significant improvement in endurance performance, 
      and paralleled the concomitant elevation in blood ketone levels. Six-week LCKD 
      feeding on its own was less effective for reducing PPWR, and more detrimental to the 
      postpartum metabolic outcomes and physical activity performance of the postpartum 
      mice. The feasibility of a LCKD with or without exercise during the postpartum 
      period as a strategy for managing PPWR and improving postpartum metabolic profiles 
      should be carefully considered.

TI  - Effects of exercise on high-fat diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and 
      lipid metabolism in ApoE knockout mice.
PG  - 10
LID - 10.1186/s12986-022-00644-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is growing more common 
      in the Western world, has become the main cause of chronic liver disease and is 
      strongly associated with metabolism syndromes. NAFLD can indicate a wide spectrum of 
      hepatic pathologies, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis and inflammatory 
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis to more severe stages of fibrosis and cirrhosis. 
      Moreover, evidence has demonstrated that physical inactivity and westernized dietary 
      habits may facilitate the development of NAFLD. Lipid modulation and metabolism 
      could be important factors in the development of steatosis. Lipid species, 
      characterized using a lipidomic approach with untargeted analysis, could provide 
      potential biomarkers for the pathogenesis of NAFLD or therapeutic applications. 
      Thus, in this study, the effects of exercise on the improvement of NAFLD were 
      further investigated from a lipidomic perspective through the aspects of lipid 
      regulation and metabolism. METHODS: Wild type (WT) C57BL/6 J and 
      C57BL/6-ApoE(em1Narl)/Narl mice were assigned to one of four groups: WT mice fed a 
      normal chow diet (CD), apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout mice fed a normal CD, ApoE 
      knockout mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD), and ApoE knockout mice fed a HFD and 
      provided with swimming exercise. The treatments (e.g., normal diet, HFD, and 
      exercise) were provided for 12 consecutive weeks before the growth curves, 
      biochemistry, fat composition, pathological syndromes, and lipid profiles were 
      determined. RESULTS: Exercise significantly reduced the HFD-induced obesity (weight 
      and fat composition), adipocyte hypertrophy, liver lipid accumulation, and 
      pathological steatosis. In addition, exercise ameliorated HFD-induced steatosis in 
      the process of NAFLD. The lipidomic analysis revealed that the changes in plasma 
      triglyceride (14:0/16:0/22:2), phosphatidic acid (18:0/17:2), and 
      phosphatidylglycerol (16:0/20:2) induced by the administration of the HFD could be 
      reversed significantly by exercise. CONCLUSIONS: The 12-week regular exercise 
      intervention significantly alleviated HFD-induced NAFLD through modulation of 
      specific lipid species in plasma. This finding could elucidate the lipids effects 
      behind the hepatic pathogenesis with exercise.

TI  - Does exercise beneficially affect sex hormones when added to hypo-caloric diets in 
      adults with overweight or obesity? A systematic review and meta-analysis of 
      controlled clinical trials.
PG  - 285-295
LID - 10.1530/EJE-21-0675 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is no consensus of opinion if exercise beneficially affects sex 
      hormones if added to weight-loss diets. The purpose of this study was to perform a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials to evaluate the 
      effect of adding exercise to a hypo-caloric diet during a weight-loss program, on 
      serum testosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in adults 
      with overweight/obesity. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of the 
      literature. METHODS: Online databases including PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, ISI 
      Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched up to April 2021. A random-effects 
      model was applied to compare mean changes in sex hormones and SHBG between 
      participants undergoing a hypo-caloric diet with or without exercise. RESULTS: In 
      total, 9 eligible clinical trials with 462 participants were included. Out of these, 
      seven, three, and four studies illustrated changes in testosterone, estradiol, and 
      SHBG, respectively. The meta-analysis revealed that exercise had no significant 
      effect on circulating testosterone (WMD = -0.03 nmol/L, 95% CI: -0.11, 0.06, P = 
      0.51), estradiol (WMD = -0.46 pg/mL, 95% CI: -1.57, 0.65, P = 0.42), and SHBG (WMD = 
      0.54 nmol/L, 95% CI: -2.63, 3.71, P = 0.74) when added to low-calorie diets. 
      CONCLUSION: The addition of exercise to a hypo-caloric diet provided no additional 
      improvement in sex hormone profiles. Further, well-designed randomized controlled 
      trials with longer follow-up periods in both sexes are recommended to confirm and 
      expand the current results.

TI  - Managing Food Allergy When the Patient Is Not Highly Allergic.
PG  - 46-55
LID - S2213-2198(21)00608-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jaip.2021.05.021 [doi]
AB  - Few patients with food allergy are "highly allergic," meaning they always have 
      severe reactions and always react to very small amounts of allergen. Standard 
      medical approaches for allergy management have focused on the safety and lifestyle 
      modifications this group truly needs, but consequently families with food allergy 
      are typically advised to strictly avoid any exposure to their implicated allergens. 
      Most food-allergic subjects are actually not reactive to very low doses, and many 
      never experience severe reactions. There are also notable conditions where a 
      different care plan is already commonly offered: patients with pollen-related food 
      allergy syndrome, with food-associated exercise-induced anaphylaxis, and with 
      resolving or mild milk or egg allergy might be advised to ingest the allergens in 
      specific circumstances with detailed instructions. Because oral immunotherapy and 
      allergy prevention by early exposure have emphasized alternatives to strict 
      avoidance, there is increasing interest in prospects to forego strict avoidance in 
      those with food allergy. For patients with a high threshold of reactivity (low-dose 
      tolerant, high-dose mildly reactive), there may be options such as allowing the 
      ingestion of products with precautionary allergen labels, allowing dietary 
      indiscretions with small amounts of the allergen, or even encouraging ingestion of 
      subthreshold amounts with therapeutic intent. These practices have not been 
      extensively studied and could be considered controversial. If these approaches are 
      considered, shared decision making is needed in discussing them with patients and 
      families. This review considers the potential approaches to those who are "not 
      highly allergic": the risks, benefits, shared decision making, and research needs.

TI  - Fear, violence, inequality, and stunting in Guatemala.
PG  - e23627
LID - 10.1002/ajhb.23627 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stunting is defined by the public health community as a length- or 
      height-for-age <-2 SD of a growth standard or reference and is claimed to be caused 
      by poor nutrition, repeated infection, and inadequate psychosocial stimulation. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Stunting is common at all income levels in middle- and 
      low-income countries. At the higher income levels, stunting is unlikely to be caused 
      by nutrient deficiency or infectious disease. RESULTS: In Guatemala, 17% of 
      <5-year-olds in the highest family income quintile are stunted. Guatemala has a 
      history of violence from armed conflict, current-day social and economic 
      inequalities, government corruption, and threat of kidnapping for the wealthiest 
      families. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The high level of persistent violence creates 
      an ecology of fear, an extreme range of inequalities in 
      Social-Economic-Political-Emotional resources, and biosocial stress that inhibits 
      skeletal growth and causes stunting for people of all income levels.

TI  - The mitochondrial profile in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: impact of 
      exercise.
LID - JME-21-0177.R2 [pii]
LID - 10.1530/JME-21-0177 [doi]
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder affecting 
      pre-menopausal women, and involves metabolic dysregulation. Despite the high 
      prevalence of insulin resistance, the existence of mitochondrial dysregulation and 
      its role in the pathogenesis of PCOS is not clear. Exercise is recommended as 
      first-line therapy for women with PCOS. In particular, high-intensity interval 
      training (HIIT) is known to improve metabolic health and enhance mitochondria 
      characteristics. In this narrative review the existing knowledge of mitochondrial 
      characteristics in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue of women with PCOS, and the 
      effect of exercise interventions in ameliorating metabolic and mitochondrial health 
      in these women are discussed. Even though the evidence on mitochondrial dysfunction 
      in PCOS is limited, some studies point to aberrant mitochondrial functions mostly in 
      skeletal muscle, while there is very little research in adipose tissue. Although 
      most exercise intervention studies in PCOS report improvements in metabolic health, 
      they show diverse and inconclusive findings in relation to mitochondrial 
      characteristics. A limitation of the current studies are the lack of comprehensive 
      mitochondrial analyses and the diversity in exercise modalities, with only one study 
      investigating the impact of HIIT alone. Therefore, further comprehensive large-scale 
      exercise intervention studies are required to understand the association between 
      metabolic dysfunction and aberrant mitochondrial profile, and the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying the exercise-induced metabolic adaptations in women with PCOS.

TI  - The predicting value of resting heart rate to identify undiagnosed diabetes in 
      Korean adult: Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
PG  - e2022009
LID - 10.4178/epih.e2022009 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the current study is to examine 1) whether the addition 
      of resting heart rate (RHR) to existing undiagnosed diabetes (UnDM) prediction model 
      would improve predictability, 2) to develop and validate UnDM prediction model by 
      only using easily assessable variables such as age, gender, RHR and waist 
      circumference (WC). METHODS: Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
      (KNHANES) 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 data were used to develop the model (model building 
      set, N=19,675) and KNHANES data from 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017 were used to validate 
      the model (validation set, N=19,917). UnDM was defined as a fasting glucose level ≥ 
      126mg/dL or hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5%, yet has not been diagnosed by doctors. SPSS 
      logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors of UnDM. RESULTS: Age, 
      RHR, waist circumference (WC) were associated with UnDM. When RHR was added to the 
      existing model, sensitivity was reduced (86% vs. 73%) while specificity was 
      increased (49% vs. 65%), expressed as higher Youden index (35 vs. 38). When only 
      age, sex, WC and RHR were used in the model, sensitivity of 70%, and specificity of 
      67% with Youden index of 37 were observed. CONCLUSION: Adding RHR to existing UnDM 
      prediction model improved specificity and Youden index. Furthermore, prediction 
      model only used age, sex, RHR and WC were not inferior to existing prediction model.

TI  - Early postoperative feeding following surgery for upper gastrointestinal cancer: A 
      systematic review.
PG  - 33-48
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12930 [doi]
AB  - Nutrition post major upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer surgery is a significant 
      consideration known to affect postoperative recovery and the ability to tolerate 
      adjuvant treatment. This systematic review assessed the effect of early oral feeding 
      (EOF), compared to traditional timing of oral feeding, following major surgery for 
      UGI cancer on postoperative complications, postoperative length of hospital stay 
      (LOS), nutritional status and quality of life (QOL). The literature was searched up 
      to March 9th 2020 using CINHAL, PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science 
      databases. Quality assessment was completed using the Academy of Nutrition and 
      Dietetics quality criteria checklist. Fifteen articles were included, consisting of 
      seven randomised controlled trials, six cohort studies and two non-randomised 
      trials, with a total of 2517 participants. The type and timing of EOF varied 
      considerably across studies with limited reporting of energy and protein intakes 
      from oral or enteral feeding. Fourteen studies assessed postoperative complications 
      of which 13 reported no difference between EOF and standard care. Fourteen studies 
      assessed postoperative LOS and of these, 13 reported a reduced length of stay in the 
      EOF group. Four of 15 studies assessing nutritional status found no difference 
      between groups. Three of 15 studies assessed QOL with inconsistent findings. This 
      review found EOF reduced postoperative LOS and did not increase postoperative 
      complications. However, the optimal timing for the introduction of EOF could not be 
      established. Furthermore, the type of EOF varied considerably making comparison 
      across studies challenging and demonstrates a need for internationally standardised 
      definitions.

AB  - Oats are a rich source of a soluble fibre, beta-glucan, phenolic compounds, as well 
      as functional lipid and protein components that could potentially aid in preventing 
      and managing hypertension. Processing techniques commonly used to manufacture oat 
      based foods have been shown to improve its physiological efficacy. Hypertension is a 
      common condition that is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, a primary cause 
      of mortality worldwide. Though exercise and pharmacological interventions are often 
      used in the management of hypertension, diet is an incredibly important factor. One 
      preclinical study and a handful of clinical studies have shown that oat 
      components/products are effective in lowering blood pressure. However, research in 
      this area is limited and more studies are needed to elucidate the anti-hypertensive 
      potential of oats.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Careful development of interventions using principles of co-production 
      is now recognized as an important step for clinical trial development, but practical 
      guidance on how to do this in practice is lacking. This paper aims (1) provide 
      practical guidance for researchers to co-produce interventions ready for clinical 
      trial by describing the 4-stage process we followed, the challenges experienced and 
      practical tips for researchers wanting to co-produce an intervention for a clinical 
      trial; (2) describe, as an exemplar, the development of our intervention package. 
      METHOD: We used an Integrated Knowledge Translation (IKT) approach to co-produce a 
      telehealth-delivered exercise program for people with stroke. The 4-stage process 
      comprised of (1) a start-up planning phase with the co-production team. (2) Content 
      development with knowledge user informants. (3) Design of an intervention protocol. 
      (4) Protocol refinement. RESULTS AND REFLECTIONS: The four stages of intervention 
      development involved an 11-member co-production team and 32 knowledge user 
      informants. Challenges faced included balancing conflicting demands of different 
      knowledge user informant groups, achieving shared power and collaborative decision 
      making, and optimising knowledge user input. Components incorporated into the 
      telehealth-delivered exercise program through working with knowledge user informants 
      included: increased training for intervention therapists; increased options to 
      tailor the intervention to participant's needs and preferences; and re-naming of the 
      program. Key practical tips include ways to minimise the power differential between 
      researchers and consumers, and ensure adequate preparation of the co-production 
      team. CONCLUSION: Careful planning and a structured process can facilitate 
      co-production of complex interventions ready for clinical trial.

TI  - Exercise-induced changes on exerkines that might influence brown adipose tissue

AB  - In rodents, exercise alters the plasma concentration of exerkines that regulate 
      white adipose tissue (WAT) browning or brown adipose tissue (BAT) metabolism. This 
      study aims to analyse the acute and chronic effect of exercise on the circulating 
      concentrations of 16 of these exerkines in humans. Ten young sedentary adults (6 
      female) performed a maximum walking effort test and a resistance exercise session. 
      The plasma concentration of 16 exerkines was assessed before, and 3, 30, 60, and 
      120 minutes after exercise. Those exerkines modified by exercise were additionally 
      measured in another 28 subjects (22 women). We also measured the plasma 
      concentrations of the exerkines before and after a 24-week exercise program 
      (endurance + resistance; 3-groups: control, moderate-intensity and 
      vigorous-intensity) in 110 subjects (75 women). Endurance exercise acutely increased 
      the plasma concentration of lactate, norepinephrine, brain-derived neurotrophic 
      factor, interleukin 6, and follistatin-like protein 1 (3 minutes after exercise), 
      and musclin and fibroblast growth factor 21 (30 and 60 minutes after exercise), 
      decreasing the plasma concentration of leptin (30 minutes after exercise). 
      Adiponectin, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), β-aminoisobutyric acid, 
      meteorin-like, follistatin, pro-ANP, irisin and myostatin were not modified or not 
      detectable. The resistance exercise session increased the plasma concentration of 
      lactate 3 minutes after exercise. Chronic exercise did not alter the plasma 
      concentration of these exerkines. In sedentary young adults, acute endurance 
      exercise releases to the bloodstream exerkines that regulate BAT metabolism and WAT 
      browning. In contrast, neither a low-volume resistance exercise session nor a 
      24-week training program modified plasma levels of these molecules.Trial

TI  - Dietary interventions on the prevention and management of diabetes in post-kidney 
      transplantation - A systematic review.
PG  - 269-280

AB  - Post-transplant diabetes mellitus is associated with long-term immunosuppression and 
      weight gain, and is related to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, 
      accelerated loss of graft and increased mortality. There is an absence of strong 
      evidence-based dietary guidelines for the prevention and management of 
      post-transplant diabetes mellitus in kidney transplant recipients. The aim of this 
      study was to systematically review all dietary evidence for kidney transplant 
      recipients on clinical outcomes relating to diabetes, patient-reported outcomes and 
      economic outcomes. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in August 2020 
      using the databases Medline, Embase, CENTRAL and CINAHL. Studies were critically 
      appraised using Cochrane risk of bias tools and GRADE. A total of 12 studies and 
      1928 participants were included. Four papers focused on diet and exercise, one paper 
      on diet only, two papers on magnesium supplementation, one paper on magnesium and 
      fibre intake, two papers on Mediterranean diet, one paper on marine n-3 fatty acid 
      supplementation and one paper on fruit and vegetable intake. There were no 
      significant effects on outcomes relating to dietary counselling, magnesium 
      supplementation, magnesium and fibre intake or marine n-3 fatty acid 
      supplementation. Low-quality evidence supports the Mediterranean diet in reducing 
      the risk of post-transplant diabetes mellitus and fasting plasma glucose levels. 
      Low-quality evidence suggests vegetable intake being associated with a lower risk of 
      post-transplant diabetes mellitus. This review demonstrates limited evidence for 
      dietary interventions in the prevention and management of diabetes in post-kidney 
      transplantation. The findings suggest that further high-quality research with robust 
      study designs is required.

AB  - Maternal low-protein and postnatal high-fat (HF) diets program offspring obesity and 
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk by epigenetically reducing beige adipocytes 
      (BAs) via increased G9a protein expression (Histone3 Lysine9 dimethyl transferase), 
      an inhibitor of the BA marker fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). Conversely, 
      offspring exercise reduces fat mass and white adipocytes, but the mechanisms are not 
      yet understood. This work investigated whether exercise reduces offspring obesity 
      and T2DM risk caused by a maternal HF diet via regulation of G9a and FGF21 
      expression that would convert white to BA. Two-month-old female C57Bl/6J mice (F0) 
      were fed a 16% (normal fat; NF) or a 45% HF diet for 3 months prior to breeding, and 
      subsequent gestation and lactation. Male offspring (F1) were fed the same NF and HF 
      diets and further divided into either sedentary (S) or voluntary wheel running (Ex) 
      groups for an additional 3 months yielding eight groups: NF (maternal treatment 
      condition)-NF-S (postweaning treatment conditions), NF-HF-S, NF-NF-Ex, NF-HF-Ex, 
      HF-NF-S, HF-HF-S, HF-NF-Ex, and HF-HF-Ex. Subcutaneous adipose tissue was collected 
      for protein and mRNA analysis of FGF21, peroxisome proliferator-activated 
      receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC-1 alpha, inducer of FGF21), G9a, E4BP4 (G9a 
      coactivator), and protein expression of H3K9 demethylases (KDM4C). Postnatal HF diet 
      decreased FGF21 positive BA numbers regardless of maternal diets and postnatal 
      exercise. Under sedentary conditions, postnatal HF diet increased protein expression 
      of FGF21 transcription inhibitors G9a and E4BP4 compared to NF diet resulting in 
      decreased FGF21 expression. In contrast, postnatal HF diet and exercise decreased 
      G9a and E4BP4 protein expression while decreasing FGF21 expression compared to NF 
      diet. Under exercised condition, postnatal HF diet-induced KDM4C protein expression 
      while no changes in KDM4C protein expression were induced by postnatal HF diet under 
      sedentary conditions. These findings suggest that the postnatal diet exerts a 
      greater impact on offspring adiposity and BA numbers than maternal diets. These data 
      also suggest that offspring exercise induces KDM4C to counter the increase in G9a 
      that was triggered by maternal and postnatal HF diets. Future studies need to 
      determine whether KDM4C induces methylation status of G9a to alter thermogenic 
      function of BA.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Literature On the Representation of Racial and Ethnic 
      Minority Groups in Clinical Nutrition Interventions.
LID - nmac002 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/advances/nmac002 [doi]
AB  - The racial and ethnic disparities in diet-related chronic diseases are major 
      concerns. This systematic review examines the extent to which diet-induced changes 
      in health outcomes such as cardiometabolic, inflammation, cancer, bone health, 
      kidney function outcomes etc., have been reported and discussed by race or ethnicity 
      in randomized trials with 2 or more diet arms that recruited both minority and 
      non-Hispanic White groups. Databases i.e., PubMed, Cochrane library and Web of 
      Science were searched up to August 2021. Thirty-four studies that discussed effects 
      of defined dietary interventions on health outcomes by racial or ethnic minority 
      group vs. non-Hispanic Whites were included in the systematic review (PROSPERO 
      registration number: CRD42021229256). Acute trials and those with one diet arm that 
      accounted for race or ethnicity in their analyses, and studies that focused on a 
      single racial or ethnic group were discussed separately. Most studies were conducted 
      in Black vs. White adults testing effects of energy restriction, macronutrient 
      modification, sodium reduction, or variations of the Dietary Approaches to Stop 
      Hypertension (DASH) diet on cardiometabolic outcomes. There was limited focus on 
      other minority groups. Evidence suggests greater blood pressure reduction for Black 
      adults compared to Whites particularly on DASH (or similar) diets. Overall, there 
      was limited consideration for group-specific eating patterns and diet acceptability. 
      Overall risk of bias was low. With emerging precision nutrition initiatives that aim 
      to optimize metabolic responses in population subgroups through tailored approaches, 
      it is imperative to ensure adequate representation of racial and ethnic subgroups 
      for addressing health disparities. Factors that help explain variability in 
      responses such as socioecological context should be included and adequately powered. 
      Given the racial and ethnic disparities in chronic diseases, studying the adoption, 
      maintenance, and effectiveness of dietary interventions on health outcomes among 
      different groups is critical for developing approaches that can mitigate 
      diet-related health disparities.

AB  - This work aimed to evaluate the effects of whey protein concentrate (WPC) admixtured 
      of curcumin on metabolic control, inflammation and oxidative stress in Wistar rats 
      submitted to exhaustive exercise. A total of forty-eight male rats were divided into 
      six experimental groups (n 8): standard diet group (AIN-93M), standard diet 
      submitted to exhaustion test group (AIN-93M ET), WPC admixtured of curcumin group 
      (WPC + CCM), WPC + CCM submitted to exhaustion test group (WPC + CCM ET), CCM group 
      and CCM subjected to exhaustion test group (CCM ET). The swimming exhaustion test 
      was performed after 4 weeks of experiment. The consumption of WPC + CCM as well as 
      isolated CCM did not alter the biometric measurements, the animals' food consumption 
      and the hepatic and kidney function, as well as the protein balance of the animals 
      (P > 0·05), but reduced the glycaemia and the gene expression of TNF-α and IL-6 and 
      increased the expression of IL-10 (P < 0·05). The animals that were submitted to the 
      exhaustion test (AIN-93M ET) showed higher aspartate aminotransferase values when 
      compared to the animals that did not perform the exercise (AIN-93 M) (P < 0·05). WPC 
      + CCM reduced the concentration of nitric oxide, carbonylated protein and increased 
      the concentration of catalase (P < 0·05). Both (WPC + CCM and CCM) were able to 
      increase the concentrations of superoxide dismutase (P < 0·05). We concluded that 
      the WPC admixtured of CCM represents a strategy capable of decreasing blood glucose 
      and oxidative and inflammatory damage caused by exhaustive physical exercise in 
      swimming.

TI  - Exercise-induced Bronchodilation Equalizes Exercise Ventilatory Mechanics despite 
      Variable Baseline Airway Function in Asthma.
PG  - 258-266
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000002793 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We quantified the magnitude of exercise-induced bronchodilation in adult 
      asthmatics under conditions of narrowed and dilated airways. We then assessed the 
      effect of the bronchodilation on ventilatory capacity and the extent of ventilatory 
      limitation during exercise. METHODS: Eleven asthmatics completed three exercise 
      bouts on a cycle ergometer. Exercise was preceded by no treatment (trialCON), 
      inhaled β2 agonist (trialBD), or a eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea challenge (trialBC). 
      Maximal expiratory flow-volume maneuvers (MEFV) were performed before and within 40 
      s of exercise cessation. Exercise tidal flow-volume loops were placed within the 
      preexercise and postexercise MEFV curve and used to determine expiratory flow 
      limitation and maximum ventilatory capacity (V˙ECap). RESULTS: Preexercise airway 
      function was different among the trials (forced expiratory volume 1 s during 
      trialCON, trialBD, and trialBC = 3.3 ± 0.8 L, 3.8 ± 0.8 L, and 2.9 ± 0.8 L, 
      respectively; P < 0.05). Maximal expired airflow increased with exercise during all 
      three trials, but the increase was greatest during trialBC (delta forced expiratory 
      volume 1 s during trialCON, trialBD, and trialBC = +12.2% ± 13.1%, +5.2% ± 5.7%, 
      +28.1% ± 15.7%). Thus, the extent of expiratory flow limitation decreased, and 
      V˙ECap increased, when the postexercise MEFV curve was used. During trialCON and 
      trialBC, actual exercise ventilation exceeded V˙ECap calculated with the preexercise 
      MEFV curve in seven and nine subjects, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These findings 
      demonstrate the critical importance of exercise bronchodilation in the asthmatic 
      with narrowed airways. Of clinical relevance, the results also highlight the 
      importance of assessing airway function during or immediately after exercise in 
      asthmatic persons; otherwise, mechanical limitations to exercise ventilation will be 
      overestimated.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: It is well documented that insufficient physical activity (PA) 
      contributes substantially to cardiovascular diseases. The number of physically 
      active people in Germany is still too low. METHODS: In ELITE study in Germany, 4602 
      participants are regularly examined for cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF). The aim 
      is to motivate participants to improve their CVRF through individual recommendations 
      and regular follow-up. Here, the PA data are presented in correlation with CVRF at 
      baseline. A feature of this presentation is that the usual CVRF but also the effects 
      on psychosocial factors were recorded simultaneously. RESULTS: Participants were 
      divided into 3 groups based on their PA: 1. frequent exercise (FE): daily to 2-3x 
      per week (41.4%), 2. moderate exercise (ME): 1x/week to 2x/month (28.8%), 3. rarely 
      exercise (RE): 1x/month to not at all (29.8%). Age did not differ in the 3 groups. 
      The most common CVRF was arterial hypertension, which decreased significantly with 
      an increase in PA. Diabetes, nicotine, and increased BMI were also significantly 
      less frequent in group 1. Antihypertensives were taken less frequently in this group 
      1. Less physically active participants were significantly more likely to have 3 or 
      more additional CVRF. While group 1 consumed more fruit (64%) and considerably less 
      pork, in group 2 and 3 only 58.3% and 50.3% respectively included fruit in their 
      diet. FE also had a favorable effect on stress, depression and general well-being, 
      all of which were significantly better in group 1. CONCLUSION: Results confirm the 
      beneficial influences of exercise on known CVRF and on psychosocial parameters. The 
      prevalence of several CVRF per person at low levels of sport is of particular 
      concern, as these participants would benefit most. During a 5-year follow-up, 
      participants will receive intensive education on the need to increase PA. It remains 
      to be seen how successful the effort will be.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To verify the effects of different modalities of physical exercise on 
      brain activity of older adults. METHODS: Systematic searches were conducted 
      according to the PICOS strategy and the following databases were searched: PubMed, 
      Web of Science, PsycInfo and Scielo. Two independent evaluators performed the 
      initial selection from reading the title and abstract based on the stipulated 
      eligibility criteria. RESULTS: The searches resulted in 1935 titles, of which 97 
      were duplicated and 1793 were excluded based on reading the titles and abstracts. 
      This phase resulted in 45 articles for detailed analysis. At this stage, 35 articles 
      were excluded because they did not meet the eligibility criteria. The information 
      for qualitative analysis was extracted from 10 articles that met the criteria. 
      CONCLUSION: There was improvement in the brain activity of older adults regardless 
      of the type of physical exercise performed (aerobic, neuromuscular, flexibility or 
      neuromotor), but with a discrete advantage for balance and coordination exercises 
      (neuromotor).

TI  - The association between low calf circumference and mortality: a systematic review 
      and meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s41999-021-00603-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Low calf circumference is an important indicator of malnutrition and has 
      been widely studied, especially among older adults. However, data on the association 
      between low calf circumference and mortality have been inconsistent. This systematic 
      review was aimed to quantify this association. METHODS: The internet databases 
      (PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect and Cochrane Library databases) were systematically 
      searched from inception to November 01, 2021 for studies investigating the 
      association between low calf circumference and mortality. A random effects model was 
      adopted to pool the relevant data. RESULTS: Low calf circumference was associated 
      with a higher risk of mortality than normal calf circumference, with a pooled HR of 
      2.42 (95% CI 1.97-2.97, I(2) = 74.3%). In addition, this association between low 
      calf circumference and morality was still statistically significant in the subgroup 
      analysis across different settings, including hospitals (pooled HR = 2.63, 95% CI 
      1.93-3.58), nursing homes (pooled HR = 2.49, 95% CI 1.76-3.54), and communities 
      (pooled HR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.60-3.07). Other subgroup analyses based on different 
      cutoffs of calf circumference showed that, compared to individual with normal calf 
      circumference, participants with low calf circumference had an increased risk of 
      mortality (pooled HR = 2.66, 95% CI 2.06-3.43) when using the Asian Working Group 
      for Sarcopenia (AWGS) criterion (≤ 34 cm for males and ≤ 33 cm for females). Similar 
      results were found when the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) criterion (≤ 31 cm) 
      was used, with a pooled HR of 2.11 (95% CI 1.59-2.81). CONCLUSION: Calf 
      circumference, which is simple and convenient to measure, could be used to stratify 
      the high-risk group, as low calf circumference was significantly associated with 
      mortality among patients. Interventions, including exercise and nutrition programs, 
      could be conducted promptly once low calf circumference is detected.

TI  - Benefits in cardiac function by CD38 suppression: Improvement in NAD(+) levels, 
      exercise capacity, heart rate variability and protection against 
      catecholamine-induced ventricular arrhythmias.
PG  - 11-22
LID - S0022-2828(22)00019-0 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.yjmcc.2022.01.008 [doi]
AB  - CD38 enzymatic activity regulates NAD(+) and cADPR levels in mammalian tissues, and 
      therefore has a prominent role in cellular metabolism and calcium homeostasis. 
      Consequently, it is reasonable to hypothesize about its involvement in 
      cardiovascular physiology as well as in heart related pathological conditions. AIM: 
      To investigate the role of CD38 in cardiovascular performance, and its involvement 
      in cardiac electrophysiology and calcium-handling. METHODS AND RESULTS: When 
      submitted to a treadmill exhaustion test, a way of evaluating cardiovascular 
      performance, adult male CD38KO mice showed better exercise capacity. This benefit 
      was also obtained in genetically modified mice with catalytically inactive (CI) CD38 
      and in WT mice treated with antibody 68 (Ab68) which blocks CD38 activity. Hearts 
      from these 3 groups (CD38KO, CD38CI and Ab68) showed increased NAD(+) levels. When 
      CD38KO mice were treated with FK866 which inhibits NAD(+) biosynthesis, exercise 
      capacity as well as NAD(+) in heart tissue decreased to WT levels. 
      Electrocardiograms of conscious unrestrained CD38KO and CD38CI mice showed lower 
      basal heart rates and higher heart rate variability than WT mice. Although 
      inactivation of CD38 in mice resulted in increased SERCA2a expression in the heart, 
      the frequency of spontaneous calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum under 
      stressful conditions (high extracellular calcium concentration) was lower in CD38KO 
      ventricular myocytes. When mice were challenged with caffeine-epinephrine, CD38KO 
      mice had a lower incidence of bidirectional ventricular tachycardia when compared to 
      WT ones. CONCLUSION: CD38 inhibition improves exercise performance by regulating 
      NAD(+) homeostasis. CD38 is involved in cardiovascular function since its genetic 
      ablation decreases basal heart rate, increases heart rate variability and alters 
      calcium handling in a way that protects mice from developing catecholamine induced 
      ventricular arrhythmias.

      Participants: A Systematic Review with Meta-analysis and Meta-regression.
LID - 10.1007/s40279-022-01644-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies investigating the effects of cold-water immersion (CWI) on the 
      recovery of athletic performance, perceptual measures and creatine kinase (CK) have 
      reported mixed results in physically active populations. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of 
      this systematic review was to investigate the effects of CWI on recovery of athletic 
      performance, perceptual measures and CK following an acute bout of exercise in 
      physically active populations. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis 
      and meta-regression. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in September 2021 
      using Medline, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EmCare and 
      Embase databases. Studies were included if they were peer reviewed and published in 
      English, included participants who were involved in sport or deemed physically 
      active, compared CWI with passive recovery methods following an acute bout of 
      strenuous exercise and included athletic performance, athlete perception and CK 
      outcome measures. Studies were divided into two strenuous exercise subgroups: 
      eccentric exercise and high-intensity exercise. Random effects meta-analyses were 
      used to determine standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals. 
      Meta-regression analyses were completed with water temperature and exposure 
      durations as continuous moderator variables. RESULTS: Fifty-two studies were 
      included in the meta-analyses. CWI improved the recovery of muscular power 24 h 
      after eccentric exercise (SMD 0.34 [95% CI 0.06-0.62]) and after high-intensity 
      exercise (SMD 0.22 [95% CI 0.004-0.43]), and reduced serum CK (SMD - 0.85 [95% 
      CI - 1.61 to - 0.08]) 24 h after high-intensity exercise. CWI also improved muscle 
      soreness (SMD - 0.89 [95% CI - 1.48 to - 0.29]) and perceived feelings of recovery 
      (SMD 0.66 [95% CI 0.29-1.03]) 24 h after high-intensity exercise. There was no 
      significant influence on the recovery of strength performance following either 
      eccentric or high-intensity exercise. Meta-regression indicated that shorter time 
      and lower temperatures were related to the largest beneficial effects on serum CK 
      (duration and temperature dose effects) and endurance performance (duration dose 
      effects only) after high-intensity exercise. CONCLUSION: CWI was an effective 
      recovery tool after high-intensity exercise, with positive outcomes occurring for 
      muscular power, muscle soreness, CK, and perceived recovery 24 h after exercise. 
      However, after eccentric exercise, CWI was only effective for positively influencing 
      muscular power 24 h after exercise. Dose-response relationships emerged for 
      positively influencing endurance performance and reducing serum CK, indicating that 
      shorter durations and lower temperatures may improve the efficacy of CWI if used 
      after high-intensity exercise. FUNDING: Emma Moore is supported by a Research

TI  - Acute exercise decreases insulin-stimulated extracellular vesicles in conjunction 
      with augmentation index in adults with obesity.
LID - 10.1113/JP282274 [doi]
AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are often elevated in obesity and may modulate disease 
      risk. Although acute exercise reduces fasting EVs in adults with obesity, no data 
      exist on insulin-mediated EV responses. This study evaluated the effects of exercise 
      on EV responses to insulin in relation to vascular function. Ten (5M/5F) sedentary 
      adults with obesity (34.3 ± 3.7 kg/m(2) ) completed an evening control and acute 
      exercise condition (70% V̇O2max to expend 400 kcal). Following an overnight fast, 
      participants underwent a 2 h euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp (90 mg/dl; 
      40 mU/m(2) /min) to determine metabolic insulin sensitivity (M-value), phenotypes of 
      medium- to large-sized EVs, and aortic waveform measures. Endothelial (CD105(+) , 
      CD41(-) /CD31(+) )-, leukocyte (CD45(+) )-, platelet (CD41(+) , CD41(+) /31(+) )- 
      and tetraspanin (TX(+) )-derived EVs, as well as platelet endothelial cell adhesion 
      molecule (CD31(+) ), were determined before and after the clamp using high 
      resolution spectral flow cytometry. Although exercise did not alter fasting 
      haemodynamics, it lowered the augmentation index (AIx75, P = 0.024) and increased 
      the M-value (P = 0.042). Further, exercise decreased all fasting EVs (P < 0.01) and 
      decreased insulin-stimulated TX(+) (P = 0.060), CD31(+) (P = 0.060) and CD41(-) 
      /31(+) (P = 0.045) compared to rest. Interestingly, greater insulin-stimulated 
      decreases in CD41(-) /31(+) were associated with reduced AIx75 during the clamp 
      (r = 0.62, P = 0.059), while insulin-stimulated decreases in CD41(+) (r = -0.68, 
      P = 0.031), CD41(+) /31(+) (r = -0.69, P = 0.262), TX(+) (r = -0.66, P = 0.037) and 
      CD31(+) (r = -0.69, P = 0.028) correlated with M-value following exercise. Thus, 
      acute exercise may decrease fasting and insulin-stimulated medium- to large-size EVs 
      in conjunction with improved M-value and AIx75. More research is needed to 
      understand effects of exercise on EVs in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and 
      vascular function. KEY POINTS: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increased in states 
      of obesity and may play a role in altered insulin sensitivity and blood pressure; 
      aerobic exercise decreases fasting EV concentrations the following day in adults 
      with obesity. This study directly tested the effects of insulin on EVs and how a 
      single bout of exercise impacts these responses. Together, these data highlight the 
      positive effects of a single bout of exercise on fasting and insulin-stimulated EVs, 
      with the latter relating to increased insulin sensitivity and decreased augmentation 
      index. These results support future research identifying EVs as mechanistic factors 
      in glucose regulation and vascular function as well as clinical use of exercise to 
      reduce cardiovascular disease risk.

AB  - The American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) developed this position 
      statement to assist physicians and other health professionals in managing athletes 
      and active people with diabetes. The AMSSM selected the author panel through an 
      application process to identify members with clinical and academic expertise in the 
      care of active patients with diabetes. This article reviews the current knowledge 
      and gaps regarding the benefits and risks of various types of exercise and 
      management issues for athletes and physically active people with diabetes, including 
      nutrition and rehabilitation issues. Resistance exercises seem to be beneficial for 
      patients with type 1 diabetes, and the new medications for patients with type 2 
      diabetes generally do not need adjustment with exercise. In preparing this 
      statement, the authors conducted an evidence review and received open comment from 
      the AMSSM Board of Directors before finalizing the recommendations.

AB  - Sarcopenia, characterized by a loss of muscle strength, quantity/quality, and 
      physical performance is associated with increased mortality and poor clinical 
      outcomes in concomitant presentation with liver cirrhosis (LC). A number of 
      mechanisms are involved in sarcopenia development in LC, many of which are secondary 
      to liver dysfunction and/or iatrogenic involvement in treating LC. Sarcopenia 
      severity in this population appears to be affected by patient gender, as well as the 
      primary aetiology of LC (alcohol, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease etc.) with 
      patient demographics shifting in recent years. Clinical detection of sarcopenia in 
      this population may involve a combination of assessment tools, in addition to 
      measuring muscle mass and strength separately. Muscle mass may be assessed using 
      radiography, bioelectric impedance, ultrasound, or anthropometrics. Hand-grip 
      strength, on the other hand, may be a useful tool for evaluating muscle strength. 
      The role of malnutrition in sarcopenia is also a relevant factor, and screening 
      tools such as MELD and SARC-F may be clinically useful tools for more complete 
      diagnosis of sarcopenia in these patients. Myostatin and titin-N may represent 
      potential diagnostic biomarkers. Lastly, physical activity and nutrition remain key 
      elements of treatment. Further research is being conducted regarding the role of 
      resistance vs aerobic exercise as well as the function of complementary nutrition. 
      Continued study into the role of nutrition, physical activity and other 
      complementary therapies will be important future endeavours in the treatment of 
      sarcopenia in LC.

AB  - This systematic review was conducted to examine the cost-effectiveness of exercise 
      interventions in community-dwelling older adults. A systematic search for articles 
      published in English or Spanish was carried out in PubMed, Web of Science and 
      Cochrane Library that covered the period from the respective start date of each 
      database to October 2021. Methodological quality was assessed with the Physiotherapy 
      Evidence Database scale and quality of economic evaluation with the Quality of 
      Health Economic Studies and Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting 
      Standards. A total of 12 out of 15 studies on exercise programmes for older adults 
      reported cost-effective results. The most cost-effective training appears to be a 
      multicomponent training programme, including aerobic exercise, muscle-strengthening 
      of lower extremities, and balance and stretching training. The training methodology 
      should be of progressive moderate or vigorous intensity performed at least twice per 
      week with each session lasting 60 min for ≥6 months. The exercise programme should 
      be delivered as a group-based intervention, doing extra exercise at home to increase 
      the cost-effectiveness. These findings suggest that exercise interventions in 
      non-institutionalized older people are a cost-effective tool. Sex, age, cognitive 
      status, frailty, frequency and training duration could modify the cost-effectiveness 
      of exercise interventions. Systematic review registration. PROSPERO CRD42021231530

TI  - The Impact of the Rate of Weight Loss on Body Composition and Metabolism.
LID - 10.1007/s13679-022-00470-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Weight loss has multiple beneficial effects on body composition 
      and metabolism, but whether these depend on the rate at which body weight is lost is 
      not clear. We analyzed data from studies in which the same amount of weight loss was 
      induced rapidly or gradually. RECENT FINDINGS: Thirteen studies were included in 
      which the same percentage weight loss was achieved at slow or fast rates (range: 0.2 
      to 3.2 kg/week) by means of dietary calorie restriction, exercise, and bariatric 
      surgery. Faster rates of weight loss may result in more fat-free mass and less fat 
      mass being lost during the dynamic phase of weight reduction compared with slower 
      rates of weight loss, in conjunction with greater declines in resting energy 
      expenditure. However, these differences are attenuated after 2-4 weeks of 
      stabilization at the new, lower body weight, and do not affect the rate and amount 
      of weight regain 9-33 months later (nor the tissue composition of regained weight). 
      Differences in waist circumference, visceral and liver fat contents, resting blood 
      pressure, fasting blood lipid profile, and insulin and adipokine concentrations in 
      response to different rates of weight loss are trivial. The decline in fasting 
      glucose concentration and the improvement in insulin sensitivity after 6-11% weight 
      loss are both greater with rapid than gradual weight loss, but not different after 
      18-20% weight loss. Changes in body composition and metabolism after losing the same 
      amount of body weight at different rates are largely similar, and occasional 
      differences are likely not meaningful clinically for the long-term management of 
      obesity and cardiometabolic diseases.

AB  - The acute response of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) to resistance exercise and 
      nutrition is often used to inform recommendations for exercise programming and 
      dietary interventions, particularly protein nutrition, to support and enhance muscle 
      growth with training. Those recommendations are worthwhile only if there is a 
      predictive relationship between the acute response of MPS and subsequent muscle 
      hypertrophy during resistance exercise training. The metabolic basis for muscle 
      hypertrophy is the dynamic balance between the synthesis and degradation of 
      myofibrillar proteins in muscle. There is ample evidence that the process of MPS is 
      much more responsive to exercise and nutrition interventions than muscle protein 
      breakdown. Thus, it is intuitively satisfying to translate the acute changes in MPS 
      to muscle hypertrophy with training over a longer time frame. Our aim is to examine 
      and critically evaluate the strength and nature of this relationship. Moreover, we 
      examine the methodological and physiological factors related to measurement of MPS 
      and changes in muscle hypertrophy that contribute to uncertainty regarding this 
      relationship. Finally, we attempt to offer recommendations for practical and 
      contextually relevant application of the information available from studies of the 
      acute response of MPS to optimize muscle hypertrophy with training.

TI  - Opportunities to prevent and manage undernutrition to amplify efforts to end TB.
PG  - 6-11
LID - 10.5588/ijtld.21.0488 [doi]
AB  - The bidirectional relationship between TB and nutrition is well recognized - primary 
      undernutrition is a risk factor for developing TB disease, while TB results in 
      wasting. Although nutrition support is acknowledged as an important intervention in 
      TB programmes, it is seldom afforded commensurate priority for action. TB incidence 
      and deaths worldwide are falling too slowly to meet WHO End TB Strategy milestones, 
      and the number of undernourished people is increasing, likely to be further 
      exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Undernutrition needs to be more 
      urgently and intensively addressed. This is especially true for the WHO South-East 
      Asia Region, where the high rates of undernutrition are a key driver of the TB 
      epidemic. The evidence base has been sufficiently robust for clear and workable 
      programmatic guidance to be formulated on assessment, counselling and interventions 
      for TB patients. Many high-burden countries have developed policies addressing TB 
      and nutrition. Gaps in research to date have frustrated the development of more 
      refined programmatic approaches related to addressing TB and malnutrition. Future 
      research can be shaped to inform targeted, actionable policies and programmes 
      delivering dual benefits in terms of undernutrition and TB. There are clear 
      opportunities for policy-makers to amplify efforts to end TB by addressing 
      undernutrition.

TI  - Exercise may impact on lumbar vertebrae marrow adipose tissue: Randomised controlled 
      trial.

LID - S8756-3282(22)00014-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.bone.2022.116338 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Animal and human cross-sectional data suggest that bone marrow adipose 
      tissue (MAT) may respond to mechanical loads and exercise. We conducted the first 
      randomised controlled trial of exercise on MAT modulations in humans. METHODS: Forty 
      patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (NSCLBP) were enrolled in a 
      six-month single-blinded randomised controlled trial (ACTRN12615001270505). Twenty 
      patients loaded their spines via progressive upright aerobic and resistance 
      exercises targeting major muscle groups (Exercise). Twenty patients performed 
      non-weightbearing motor control training and manual therapy (Control). Testing 
      occurred at baseline, 3-months (3mo) and 6-months (6mo). Lumbar vertebral fat 
      fraction (VFF) was measured using magnetic resonance imaging axial mDixon sequences. 
      RESULTS: When compared to baseline (percent change), lumbar vertebral fat fraction 
      (VFF; measured using magnetic resonance imaging axial mDixon sequences) was lower in 
      Exercise at 3mo at L2 (-3.7[6.8]%, p = 0.033) and L4 (-2.6[4.1]%, p = 0.015), but 
      not in Control. There were no between-group effects. The effects of Exercise on VFF 
      were sex-specific, with VFF lower in men at L2, L3, L4 at 3mo and at L1, L2, L3 and 
      L4 at 6mo (p all ≤ 0.05), but not in women. Leg and trunk lean mass were increased 
      at 3mo in Exercise. Changes in VFF correlated significantly with changes in total 
      fat (ρ = 0.40) and lean (ρ = -0.41) masses, but not with lumbar BMD (ρ = -0.10) or 
      visceral adipose tissue volume (ρ = 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: This trial provided first 
      prospective evidence in humans that a moderate exercise intervention may modulate 
      lumbar VFF as a surrogate measure of MAT at 3mo, yet not 6mo. The effect of exercise 
      on MAT may be more prominent in males than females.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine changes in cooking and dietary behaviors and health outcomes 
      following participation in A Taste of African Heritage, a culinary heritage cooking 
      course. DESIGN: One group, pre-post program design, surveys, and physical 
      assessments. SETTING: Community centers, churches, health care settings, homes, and 
      housing complexes. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (n = 586, 84% women) were recruited by 
      partner organizations from 2013-2018 across 21 states and the District of Columbia. 
      INTERVENTION(S): A 6-week cooking curriculum that teaches history, nutrition, and 
      cooking techniques to reconnect participants with the vibrant, healthy traditions of 
      the African Diaspora. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Weekly frequency of cooking, food 
      group intake, and exercise assessed by surveys, measured weight, waist 
      circumference, and blood pressure. ANALYSIS: Linear and logistic mixed-effects 
      models with random intercepts for participant and teacher, sex and site type as 
      covariates comparing pre-post physical measurements and binary behavioral outcomes, 
      P < 0.0033 for statistical significance after Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: Intake 
      frequencies of fruit, vegetable, and greens and exercise frequency were improved 
      from preprogram to postprogram (all P < 0.0021). Weight, waist circumference, and 
      systolic blood pressure were also improved from preprogram to postprogram (all P 
      <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Participation in A Taste of African Heritage 
      was associated with positive behavior changes and health outcomes. Integrating 
      cultural heritage and behaviors are positive components to connect participants to 
      healthy old ways or traditions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Preoperative optimization programs have demonstrated positive effects 
      on perioperative physical function and surgical outcomes. In nonsurgical 
      populations, physical activity and healthy diet may reduce pain and pain medication 
      requirement, but this has not been studied in surgical patients. Our aim was to 
      determine whether a preoperative diet and exercise intervention affects 
      postoperative pain and pain medication use. METHODS: Patients undergoing abdominal 
      colorectal surgery were invited to participate in a web-based patient engagement 
      program. Those enrolling in the first and third time periods received information on 
      the standard perioperative pathway (enhanced recovery after surgery [ERAS]). Those 
      enrolling in the second time period also received reminders on nutrition and 
      exercise (PREHAB + ERAS). The primary outcome was postoperative inpatient opioid 
      use. The secondary outcomes were inpatient postoperative pain scores and nonopioid 
      pain medication use. RESULTS: The ERAS and PREHAB + ERAS groups were similar in 
      demographic and operative characteristics. Subgroup analysis of patients who 
      activated their accounts demonstrated that the two groups had similar average 
      maximum daily pain scores, but the PREHAB + ERAS group (n = 158) used 15.9 fewer 
      oral morphine equivalents per postoperative inpatient day than the ERAS group 
      (n = 92), representing a 30% decrease (53 mg versus 37.1 mg, P = 0.04). The two 
      groups used comparable amounts of acetaminophen, gabapentin, and ketorolac. 
      Generalized linear models demonstrated that PREHAB + ERAS, minimally invasive 
      surgery, and older age were associated with lower inpatient opioid use. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Access to a web-based preoperative diet and exercise program may reduce inpatient 
      opioid use after major elective colorectal surgery. Further studies are necessary to 
      determine whether the degree of adherence to nutrition and physical activity 
      recommendations has a dose-dependent effect on opioid use.

TI  - "Precovery" versus recovery: Understanding the role of cherry juice in exercise 
      recovery.
LID - 10.1111/sms.14141 [doi]
AB  - Cherry juice has become a standard component of athlete recovery strategies. This 
      review covers the history of cherry juice as a recovery drink to give context to its 
      current use. Fifteen studies were identified that included a measure of muscle 
      function, soreness, or inflammation on the days following exercise and had an 
      exercise insult sufficient to assess the effectiveness of the tart cherry 
      intervention. Eight studies used a concentrated juice, three used a juice from 
      fresh-frozen cherries, two used a tart cherry concentrate gel, and two used a tart 
      cherry powder. The effective juice dose was specific to the type of drink 
      (fresh-frozen versus concentrate) but dose-response studies are lacking, and thus, 
      the optimal dose for any specific type of cherry juice is not known. Timing of the 
      dosing regimen is a critical factor. Studies have uniformly shown that muscle 
      function will recover faster on the days after exercise if juice is provided for 
      several days prior to exercise. Effects on soreness or systemic inflammation are 
      more equivocal. The available evidence does not support a regimen that begins on the 
      day of exercise or post-exercise. Tart cherry powder did not enhance any metric of 
      recovery on the days after exercise. In conclusion, the term recovery implies an 
      intervention that is introduced after an exercise insult. The term "precovery" may 
      be preferable to describe interventions that should be introduced on the days prior 
      to exercise to facilitate recovery on the days after exercise. The evidence supports 
      cherry juice as a precovery intervention across a range of athletic activities.

TI  - The Effects of Dietary Nitrate Supplementation on Explosive Exercise Performance: A 
      Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19020762 [doi]
LID - 762
AB  - Dietary nitrate supplementation is evidenced to induce physiological effects on 
      skeletal muscle function in fast-twitch muscle fibers and may enhance high-intensity 
      exercise performance. An important component of sport-specific skills is the ability 
      to perform explosive movements; however, it is unclear if nitrate supplementation 
      can impact explosive efforts. We examined the existing evidence to determine whether 
      nitrate supplementation improves explosive efforts lasting ≤ 6 s. PubMed, Scopus and 
      Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) were searched for articles using the 
      following search strategy: (nitrate OR nitrite OR beetroot) AND (supplement OR 
      supplementation) AND (explosive OR power OR high intensity OR high-intensity OR 
      sprint* OR "athletic performance"). Out of 810 studies, 18 were eligible according 
      to inclusion criteria. Results showed that 4 of the 10 sprint-type studies observed 
      improved sprint time, power output, and total work in cycling or running, whereas 4 
      of the 10 resistance-based exercise studies observed improvements to power and 
      velocity of free-weight bench press as well as isokinetic knee extension and flexion 
      at certain angular velocities. These results suggest that nitrate potentially 
      improves explosive exercise performance, but further work is required to clarify the 
      factors influencing the efficacy of nitrate in different exercise modalities.

TI  - Characteristics of community-based exercise programs for community-dwelling older 
      adults in rural/regional areas: a scoping review.
LID - 10.1007/s40520-022-02079-y [doi]
AB  - Community-based exercise programs for older adults play a potentially important role 
      in mitigating the decline in functional outcomes, body composition, psychosocial 
      outcomes, and cardiovascular health outcomes that commonly occurs with advancing 
      age. There is a limited understanding of the characteristics and effectiveness of 
      community-based exercise programs, particularly when those programs are offered 
      outside metropolitan areas. Rural/regional settings face unique challenges, such as 
      limited access to equipment/resources, transportation, and services, as well as 
      significant costs to run programs. The objective of this scoping review was to 
      characterise studies in the field that have aimed to implement community-based 
      programs in settings identified as rural / regional. A secondary aim was to 
      establish guidance for future exercise programs in this setting and highlight future 
      research directions. A total of 12 studies were conducted in settings identified as 
      rural/regional areas in various countries across the world were included. Of the 
      included studies, five were randomised controlled trials. The majority of included 
      studies reported on functional outcomes (83%) and psychosocial outcomes (75%), yet 
      only 42% reported body composition, 17% reported cardiovascular health and 17% 
      reported dietary outcomes. Low male representation was observed, with women 
      outnumbering men in 7 of 12 studies. There was also minimal investigation of 
      qualitative outcomes in existing community-based exercise programs in rural/regional 
      settings, presenting a key gap for future research to address. Study Protocol:

TI  - Effects of ankle position during the Nordic Hamstring exercise on range of motion, 
      heel contact force and hamstring muscle activation.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1080/14763141.2021.2025416 [doi]
AB  - One of the main benefits of the Nordic Hamstring Exercise (NH(E)) is that it can be 
      performed without the need of any extra material. However, numerous technical 
      execution variables such as the ankle and pelvis position can influence the 
      performance. The primary aims of this study were to investigate the effects of ankle 
      position (i.e., plantar or dorsal flexion) on Nordic Hamstring Break Point (NH(BP)), 
      repetition time and heel contact force. A secondary aim was to investigate 
      differences in biceps femoris long head and semitendinosus muscle activation. Male 
      professional field hockey players (n = 12) volunteered for the study. Paired t-tests 
      were used to analyse the effect of ankle position on muscle NH(BP), eccentric peak 
      torque and repetition time. Ankle dorsal flexion resulted in a higher NH(BP) (p 
      = 0.002, effect size [ES] = 1.48 [0.57 to 2.38]), repetition time (p = 0.004, 
      ES = 0.98 [0.24 to 1.72]) and both absolute and relative heel contact force (p 
      = 0.028, ES = 0.67 [0.01 to 1.34], p = 0.017, ES = 0.76 [0.07 to 1.44], 
      respectively) compared to plantar flexion. Muscle activation was not significant 
      different. This study showed a higher NH(BP), absolute and relative heel contact 
      force and repetition time with a dorsal flexed ankle vs. a plantar flexed ankle in 
      the NH(E), without changes in hamstrings muscle activation.

TI  - Feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the LEAD trial: a cluster randomized 
      controlled lifestyle intervention to improve hippocampal volume in older adults 
      at-risk for dementia.
PG  - 37

AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthy diet and exercise are associated with reduced risk of dementia 
      in older adults. The impact of diet and exercise interventions on brain health is 
      less consistent, especially with dietary interventions which rely on varying 
      approaches. Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy 
      of a 6-month intervention combining exercise with a novel dietary counseling 
      approach to improve hippocampal volume among older adults at-risk for dementia. 
      METHODS: Participants with vascular risk factors and subjective cognitive decline or 
      early mild cognitive impairment were cluster randomized in groups of 3-4 to the diet 
      intervention (DIET) or control education (ED) group. All participants engaged in 1 h 
      of supervised exercise per week and additional exercise at home. DIET involved 1 h 
      per week of group-based dietary counseling comprising education, goal setting, and 
      strategy training. ED involved 1 h per week of group-based brain health education 
      classes. Our primary outcome was change in hippocampal volume from baseline to 6 
      months. Secondary outcomes included changes in cognitive function, blood biomarkers, 
      diet, and fitness. Recruitment challenges and early discontinuation of the trial due 
      to COVID-19 necessitated a revised focus on feasibility and preliminary efficacy. 
      RESULTS: Of 190 older adults contacted, 14 (7%) were eligible and enrolled, 
      constituting 21% of our recruitment target. All participants completed the 
      intervention and attended 90% of exercise and DIET/ED sessions on average. All 
      6-month assessments prior to COVID-19 were completed but disruptions to in-person 
      testing resulted in incomplete data collection. No serious adverse events occurred 
      and all participants expressed positive feedback about the study. Preliminary 
      findings did not identify any significant changes in hippocampal volume; however, 
      substantial improvements in diet and HbA1c were observed with DIET compared to ED (d 
      = 1.75 and 1.07, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: High adherence and retention rates were 
      observed among participants and preliminary findings illustrate improvements in diet 
      quality and HbA1c. These results indicate that a larger trial is feasible if 
      difficulties surrounding recruitment can be mitigated. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Autonomic control of cerebral blood flow: fundamental comparisons between peripheral 
      and cerebrovascular circulations in humans.
PG  - 15-39
LID - 10.1113/JP281058 [doi]
AB  - Understanding the contribution of the autonomic nervous system to cerebral blood 
      flow (CBF) control is challenging, and interpretations are unclear. The 
      identification of calcium channels and adrenoreceptors within cerebral vessels has 
      led to common misconceptions that the function of these receptors and actions mirror 
      those of the peripheral vasculature. This review outlines the fundamental 
      differences and complex actions of cerebral autonomic activation compared with the 
      peripheral circulation. Anatomical differences, including the closed nature of the 
      cerebrovasculature, and differential adrenoreceptor subtypes, density, distribution 
      and sensitivity, provide evidence that measures on peripheral sympathetic nerve 
      activity cannot be extrapolated to the cerebrovasculature. Cerebral sympathetic 
      nerve activity seems to act opposingly to the peripheral circulation, mediated at 
      least in part by changes in intracranial pressure and cerebral blood volume. 
      Additionally, heterogeneity in cerebral adrenoreceptor distribution highlights 
      region-specific autonomic regulation of CBF. Compensatory chemo- and autoregulatory 
      responses throughout the cerebral circulation, and interactions with parasympathetic 
      nerve activity are unique features to the cerebral circulation. This crosstalk 
      between sympathetic and parasympathetic reflexes acts to ensure adequate perfusion 
      of CBF to rising and falling perfusion pressures, optimizing delivery of oxygen and 
      nutrients to the brain, while attempting to maintain blood volume and intracranial 
      pressure. Herein, we highlight the distinct similarities and differences between 
      autonomic control of cerebral and peripheral blood flow, and the regional 
      specificity of sympathetic and parasympathetic regulation within the 
      cerebrovasculature. Future research directions are outlined with the goal to further 
      our understanding of autonomic control of CBF in humans.

TI  - Skeletal muscle as a treatment target for older adults with diabetes mellitus: The 
      importance of a multimodal intervention based on functional category.
PG  - 110-120
LID - 10.1111/ggi.14339 [doi]
AB  - Although the lifespan of people with diabetes has increased in many countries, the 
      age-related increase in comorbidities (sarcopenia, frailty and disabilities) and 
      diabetic complications has become a major issue. Diabetes accelerates the aging of 
      skeletal muscles and blood vessels through mechanisms, such as increased oxidative 
      stress, chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, genetic 
      polymorphism (fat mass and obesity-associated genes) and accumulation of advanced 
      glycation end-products. Diabetes is associated with early onset, and progression of 
      muscle weakness and sarcopenia, thus resulting in diminished daily life function. 
      The type and duration of diabetes, insulin section/resistance, hyperglycemia, 
      diabetic neuropathy, malnutrition and low physical activity might affect muscular 
      loss and weakness. To prevent the decline in daily activities in older adults with 
      diabetes, resistance training or multicomponent exercise should be recommended. To 
      maintain muscle function, optimal energy and sufficient protein intake are 
      necessary. Although no specific drug enhances muscle mass and function, antidiabetic 
      drugs that increase insulin sensitivity or secretion could be candidates for 
      improvement of sarcopenia. The goals of glycemic control for older patients are 
      determined based on three functional categories through an assessment of cognitive 
      function and activities of daily living, and the presence or absence of medications 
      that pose a hypoglycemic risk. As these functional categories are associated with 
      muscle weakness, frailty and mortality risk, providing multimodal interventions 
      (exercise, nutrition, social network or support and optimal medical treatment) is 
      important, starting at the category II stage for maintenance or improvement in daily 
      life functions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2022; 22: 110-120.

LID - 10.1242/dmm.049327 [doi]
AB  - Exercise interventions are beneficial for reducing the risk of age-related diseases, 
      including amyloidosis, but the underlying molecular links remain unclear. Here, we 
      investigated the protective role of interval exercise training in a mouse model of 
      age-related systemic apolipoprotein A-II amyloidosis (AApoAII) and identified 
      potential mechanisms. Mice subjected to sixteen weeks of exercise showed improved 
      whole-body physiologic functions and exhibited substantial inhibition of 
      amyloidosis, particularly in the liver and spleen. Exercise activated the hepatic 
      p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) signaling pathway and the downstream 
      transcription factor tumor suppressor p53. This activation resulted in elevated 
      expression and phosphorylation of heat shock protein beta-1 (HSPB1), a chaperone 
      that defends against protein aggregation. In amyloidosis-induced mice, the hepatic 
      p38 MAPK-related adaptive responses were additively enhanced by exercise. We 
      observed that with exercise, greater amounts of phosphorylated HSPB1 accumulated at 
      amyloid deposition areas, which we suspect inhibits amyloid fibril formation. 
      Collectively, our findings demonstrate the exercise-activated specific chaperone 
      prevention of amyloidosis, and suggest that exercise may amplify intracellular 
      stress-related protective adaptation pathways against age-associated disorders such 
      as amyloidosis.

TI  - Next Level Health: a holistic health and wellbeing program to empower New Zealand 
      women.
LID - daab205 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/heapro/daab205 [doi]
AB  - Improving equity in women's health requires gender-specific and empowering 
      approaches. However, health programs often disempower women by adopting a 
      'one-size-fits-all' approach that emphasizes diet, exercise and weight loss over 
      other important aspects like sleep and mental wellbeing. This article reports on the 
      design of Next Level Health (NLH), a program that aims to empower women through 
      developing a wide range of health behaviors to support their holistic wellbeing. NLH 
      is grounded by ethics, theory and evidence to support women to make achievable, 
      sustainable changes that are relevant to their everyday lives. Women utilized the 
      NLH framework to develop an integrative health routine across six domains: physical 
      activity, sleep, nutrition, eating behavior, self-care and stress management. The 
      framework guided them to set small, incremental goals that were adaptive to their 
      needs and built from their existing circumstances. Participants reflected on their 
      progress with a facilitator during monthly meetings, accessed a social media support 
      page and received monthly text messages. Health programs remain an essential 
      approach to improving women's health alongside community- and policy-level 
      strategies. The development of NLH exemplifies how evidence may partner with modern 
      health promotion values to inform relevant and ethical program design for women.

OAB - In western societies, health programs often focus on weight loss through exercise 
      and diet to promote women’s health. Such approaches disempower women by undervaluing 
      important factors affecting their health like stress and sleep and narrow their 
      scope for ‘health success’. This article reports on the development of Next Level 
      Health (NLH) that aims to help women gain greater health-related control by 
      broadening their approach to health. The program is designed to support women to set 
      small, achievable goals across six domains (physical activity, sleep, nutrition, 
      eating behavior, self-care, and stress management) toward developing positive and 
      sustainable health behaviors. Although women work with a facilitator each month to 
      set goals, they are ultimately in control of formulating their health plans and 
      their progression through NLH. Women can support each other by joining a community 
      of other NLH participants through a social media group. NLH offers a novel program 
      that is responsive to women’s individual health needs and broadens their potential 
      for health success.

      dietary composition, exercise patterns, and socioeconomic factors among obese women 
      with inappropriate gestational weight gain (iGWG) versus appropriate GWG (aGWG). 
      STUDY DESIGN:  Medicaid-eligible women receiving prenatal care at a tertiary care 
      center from January 2013 to December 2015 were offered individualized nutritional 
      counseling by a registered dietitian encouraging well-balanced meals and 150 min/wk 
      of exercise. We conducted a prospective case-control study of obese women (body mass 
      index or BMI ≥30) with a singleton gestation with iGWG (<11 or >20 pounds) versus 
      aGWG (11-20 pounds). Dietary intake, activity level, and socioeconomic factors were 
      compared with Chi-square, Fisher's exact, Student's t-test, and Wilcoxon Rank Sum 
      tests as indicated, and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. 
      Multivariate regression analysis for significant variables was performed. A subgroup 
      analysis of women with BMI ≥40 was planned. RESULTS:  A total of 401 women were 
      analyzed: 78% (n = 313) with iGWG and 22% (n = 88) with aGWG. Demographics were 
      similar between groups. Women with iGWG less frequently reported physician 
      reinforcement of counseling and reported more physical inactivity and unemployment; 
      there were no differences in caloric intake or macronutrient profile between groups. 
      Multivariate regression identified physician reinforcement and employment as 
      independent predictors of aGWG. Among women with BMI ≥40 (n = 133), those with iGWG 
      (78%) were less likely to attend counseling, report physician reinforcement of 
      counseling, and have adequate caloric and protein intake when compared with those 
      with aGWG (22%). Activity level and socioeconomic factors were not different between 
      groups. CONCLUSION:  Physician reinforcement of nutritional counseling, greater 
      activity level, and employment are associated with aGWG in women with BMI ≥30, while 
      individualized professional nutritional counseling and dietary modifications were 
      further associated with aGWG in women with BMI ≥40. Thus, greater focus should be 
      placed on enhancing exposure to counseling and altering nutritional and exercise 
      choices to optimize aGWG. KEY POINTS: · Physician reinforcement of nutritional 
      counseling by a dietitian is crucial for obese women.. · Physical inactivity and 
      unemployment are associated with inappropriate gestational weight gain.. · 
      Nutritional counseling is associated with appropriate gestational weight gain in 
      women with BMI ≥40..

      and Proposal for Implementation.

AB  - In the past, good food and exercise were not considered effective interventions to 
      promote recovery in orthopedic surgery, and prolonged bed rest with not many 
      calories has been deemed sufficient for the proper health restoration until the end 
      of the nineteenth century. The advancement of scientific knowledge proved just the 
      opposite, thus pushing health professionals to sustain the nutritional status and 
      physical fitness of surgical patients. Nevertheless, the impoverishment of 
      lifestyles and the lengthening of life expectancy have invariably contrasted the 
      strength of constitution, giving rise to two of the most hazardous conditions for 
      orthopedic patients: malnutrition and sarcopenia, often hiding nutrient deficits and 
      poor body composition. These conditions are known to be negative prognostic factors 
      in several areas of major surgery, including hip replacement, knee replacement, and 
      spine surgery. Scoring systems to screen for malnutrition and physical inabilities 
      exist, but disciplined management of the derived risks remains untested, potentially 
      hindering the implementation of research findings into practice. A methodical 
      approach of preoperative analysis, critical monitoring, and risk correction before 
      surgery could lead to a substantial improvement of the prognosis while warranting 
      the safety of patients and the efficiency of enhanced recovery after surgery 
      pathways. The aim of this article is to discuss from a dietetic and exercise 
      perspective the ideal nutritional and physical prehabilitation to lay the 
      foundations for designing the appropriate integration of dietitians and 
      physiotherapists in a preoperative enhanced recovery pathway. This methodical 
      analysis could effectively calculate the patient's risks, detect the best choices 
      for resolving the risk, underline the ignored aspects of perioperative care, and 
      represent a concrete means to integrate novel discoveries.

AB  - There is increasing evidence from animal and human studies suggesting that fasting 
      can play a role in disease prevention, weight control and longevity. However, few 
      studies have compared exercise performances in individuals adhering to an 
      intermittent fasting (IF) in comparison to individuals who are not. Given the rising 
      popularity of IF we aim to investigate whether this type eating pattern will improve 
      cardiovascular performance over a period of 12 weeks through VO(2) max measurements 
      in participants from a Lebanese community. Additionally, we will study the variation 
      of different health parameters, physical performance and biomarkers potentially 
      affected by IF. Participants will be recruited from a large university community and 
      randomized into 4 arms. Baseline information will be collected from all 
      participants, which includes biological, physical, nutritional, medical and 
      psychological data. Two arms will follow a time-restricted fasting diet with and 
      without physical exercise, one arm will exercise without fasting, and one will act 
      as a control group. Throughout the study, measurements will be repeated, and data 
      analysis will follow to evaluate results.

AB  - Eating at a faster speed is positively correlated with having a higher BMI. 
      Modifying eating speed may offer a treatment opportunity for those with overweight 
      and obesity. This review sought to understand the feasibility, acceptability, and 
      benefit to using eating speed interventions in paediatric clinical weight-management 
      settings. The PICO Framework was used. Clinical studies of eating speed 
      interventions as a treatment for paediatric patients with overweight or obesity were 
      included. No limits to search date were implemented. A systematic search of MEDLINE, 
      PsychINFO and EMBASE via OVID, Web of Science and JBI, Database of systematic 
      reviews and Implementation reports, along with trial registers NICE, 
      ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted. 
      Two authors were responsible for screening, extraction, and evaluation of the risk 
      of bias. Fifteen papers reporting twelve interventions addressing eating-speed were 
      identified, involving a total of 486 active participants (range 7-297). Study design 
      was weak with only one full RCT and there were some concerns over quality and risk 
      of bias (Cochrane RoB 2.0). Limited sample sizes and different measured outcomes did 
      not allow powered evaluations of effect for all outcomes. There is some indication, 
      overall, that addressing eating speed has the potential to be a beneficial adjunct 
      to clinical obesity treatment, although the pooled effect estimate did not 
      demonstrate a difference in BMISDS status following eating speed interventions 
      compared to control [pooled mean difference (0.04, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.46, N = 3)]. 
      Developments to improve the engagement to, and acceptability of, interventions are 
      required, alongside rigorous high-quality trials to evaluate effectiveness.

TI  - Finding value with prehabilitation in older persons receiving surgery.
PG  - 19-24
LID - 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000581 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients presenting for surgery are increasingly older and frail. 
      Prehabilitation offers the best hope of preemptive functional optimisation to 
      improve postoperative outcomes. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses show signals of 
      improved function and reduced complications and length of stay, but are hampered by 
      small trials with heterogeneous nature of interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: The value 
      proposition for prehabilitation is strengthened by applying the following 
      considerations to the evidence. Multimodal prehabilitation programmes incorporating 
      elements of exercise, nutrition, and psychological preparation have a sound 
      physiological basis and will help standardise care delivery and evidence gathering. 
      Targeting prehabilitation resources at high-risk patients may yield higher returns. 
      Effective prehabilitation programmes must be individualised and pragmatic to address 
      known barriers to adherence. The evidence for functional improvement is clear and 
      this aligns with the values of older patients. A comprehensive analysis of value 
      incorporates functional, quality of life, and cost outcomes in addition to 
      conventional morbidity and mortality measures. SUMMARY: Multimodal prehabilitation 
      delivered by a multidisciplinary team improves functional outcomes following 
      surgery. Function is an integral part of multidimensional value assessment including 
      clinical and experiential measures. Future value enhancements include addressing 
      frailty and overcoming barriers through targeted programme design.

TI  - Lean Mass Loss and Altered Muscular Aerobic Capacity after Bariatric Surgery.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1159/000521242 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients undergoing weight loss surgery do not improve their aerobic 
      capacity or peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) after bariatric surgery and some still 
      complain about asthenia and/or breathlessness. We investigated the hypothesis that a 
      post-surgery muscular limitation could impact the ventilatory response to exercise 
      by evaluating the post-surgery changes in muscle mass, strength, and muscular 
      aerobic capacity, measured by the first ventilatory threshold (VT). METHODS: 
      Thirteen patients with obesity were referred to our university exercise laboratory 
      before and 6 months after bariatric surgery and were matched by sex, age, and height 
      to healthy subjects with normal weight. All subjects underwent a clinical 
      examination, blood sampling, and body composition assessment by dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry, respiratory and limb muscle strength assessments, and 
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a cyclo-ergometer. RESULTS: Bariatric surgery 
      resulted in a loss of 34% fat mass, 43% visceral adipose tissue, and 12% lean mass 
      (LM) (p < 0.001). Absolute handgrip, quadriceps, or respiratory muscle strength 
      remained unaffected, while quadriceps/handgrip strength relative to LM increased (p 
      < 0.05). Absolute VO2peak or VO2peak/LM did not improve and the first VT was 
      decreased after surgery (1.4 ± 0.3 vs. 1.1 ± 0.4 L min-1, p < 0.05) and correlated 
      to the exercising LM (LM legs) (R = 0.84, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      bariatric surgery has numerous beneficial effects, absolute VO2peak does not improve 
      and the weight loss-induced LM reduction is associated to an altered muscular 
      aerobic capacity, as reflected by an early VT triggering early exercise 
      hyperventilation.

TI  - Resident Burnout and Well-being in Otolaryngology and Other Surgical Specialties: 
      Strategies for Change.
PG  - 1945998221076482
LID - 10.1177/01945998221076482 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To perform a literature review on burnout prevalence, factors that affect 
      burnout and well-being, and solutions to address burnout in otolaryngology-head and 
      neck surgery (OTO-HNS) residents and residents in other surgical specialties. DATA 
      SOURCES: Ovid Medline, Embase, and article reference lists. REVIEW METHODS: A 
      literature search was performed to identify articles on resident burnout, distress, 
      wellness, well-being, and quality of life. Articles deemed outside the scope of the 
      current work were excluded. Search was limited to the past 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Moderate to high burnout has been reported in 35% to 86% of OTO-HNS residents. Among 
      other surgical specialties, resident burnout ranges between 58% and 66% in plastics, 
      11% and 67% in neurosurgery, 38% and 68% in urology, and 31% and 56% in orthopedics. 
      Highest burnout rates were seen in postgraduate year 2 residents. Factors 
      significantly associated with burnout included hours worked (>80 h/wk), level of 
      autonomy, exercise, and program support. Reported resident work hours have steadily 
      increased: 8% of OTO-HNS residents in 2005 vs 26% in 2019 reported averaging >80 
      h/wk. Practical implications of resident burnout include decreased empathy, moral 
      distress and injury, poor health, decreased quality of life, increased attrition, 
      decreased desire to pursue fellowship, and increased likelihood of medical errors. 
      Structured mentorship programs, wellness initiatives, and increased ancillary 
      support have been associated with lower burnout rates and improvements in resident 
      well-being across specialties. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Addressing burnout, which 
      is prevalent in OTO-HNS residents, is critical to improving patient care and 
      physician well-being. Surgical specialties can share strategies to effectively 
      address resident burnout through institutional interventions, which can be essential 
      quality improvement initiatives, to promote well-being.

TI  - Analysis of sex-based differences in energy substrate utilization during 
      moderate-intensity aerobic exercise.
PG  - 29-70
LID - 10.1007/s00421-021-04802-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To explore sex-based differences in energy substrate utilization during 
      moderate-intensity aerobic exercise; to identify the underpinning candidate 
      physiological mechanisms. METHODS: Three databases were searched from inception to 
      August 2020. Pertinent studies quantifying the utilization of substrates during 
      moderate aerobic exercise in healthy men and reproductive-age women were considered. 
      Studies conducted on sedentary/recreationally active and athletic populations were 
      included and analyzed separately. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies entered the 
      meta-analysis (21 in sedentary/recreationally active, 14 in athletic populations). 
      Compared to women, the respiratory exchange ratio was significantly higher both in 
      sedentary (mean difference, MD: + 0.03; p < 0.00001) and athletic men (MD: + 0.02; 
      p < 0.0001). Greater carbohydrate oxidation was observed both in sedentary 
      (standardized MD, SMD: 0.53; p = 0.006) and athletic men (SMD: 1.24; p < 0.00001). 
      Regarding lipid substrates, sedentary men oxidized less fat than women (SMD: 
       - 0.77; p = 0.0002), while no sex-based differences in fat oxidation were observed 
      in athletes (SMD: 0.06; p = 0.77). Paucity of data prevented robust meta-analyses 
      for protein sources. Sex hormones and different adrenergic activation were the most 
      cited mechanisms to discuss sex-based differences. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analyses 
      confirmed that men display greater reliance on carbohydrates while women rely more 
      on lipids to sustain moderate aerobic exercise. The latter finding was not confirmed 
      in athletes, a novel aspect of the present study. Mechanistically driven research is 
      needed to further dissect the physiological underpinnings of sex differences in 
      substrate utilization during aerobic exercise, especially for proteins, which are 
      still less investigated than other substrates.

TI  - Recent Developments in the Assessment of Nutrition Knowledge in Athletes.
LID - 10.1007/s13668-022-00397-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Adequate nutrition knowledge may influence dietary behaviour, and 
      the performance and health of athletes. Assessment of the nutrition knowledge of 
      athletes can inform practice and provide a quantitative way to evaluate education 
      interventions. This article aims to review nutrition knowledge questionnaires 
      published in the last 5 years to identify advances, possible improvements in 
      questionnaire development and design, and challenges that remain. RECENT FINDINGS: 
      Twelve new or modified questionnaires were identified. All had undergone validity 
      and reliability testing. Advancements included quantitative measures of content 
      validity and Rasch analysis. Online questionnaires were common, with at least seven 
      using this format. Advances included use of images (n = 2), automated scored 
      feedback (n = 1), and use of applied questions. While advancements have been made in 
      validation and reliability testing and electronic delivery, new questionnaires would 
      benefit from interactive and attractive features including images, provision of 
      electronic feedback, and applied questions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine associations between dietary intake and well-being in 
      pregnancy. METHODS: This retrospective cohort analysis combined three studies: the 
      ROLO Study (a randomized controlled trial of a low-glycemic-index diet in 
      pregnancy), the Pregnancy Exercise and nutrition Research Study with smartphone 
      application support (PEARS), and a randomized controlled trial on probiotics. All 
      data were collected before study interventions (16 wk). Dietary intakes during 
      pregnancy were determined using 3-day food diaries. The five-item World Health 
      Organization Well-Being Index was used to assess mental well-being. Initial 
      associations were evaluated using Pearson correlations and further defined with 
      multiple regression analysis adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), Pobal Haase 
      and Pratschke deprivation index, and metabolic equivalent of task minutes scores. 
      RESULTS: A total of 1521 women were included in the analysis (mean age, 32+4 y; mean 
      BMI, 27 kg/m(2) [IQR, 17-56 kg/m(2)]). The mean well-being score was 59%. Regression 
      analysis showed that fiber (B = 0.07; P = 0.02), magnesium (B = 0.08; P < 0.01), 
      niacin (B = 0.09; P < 0.01), thiamine (B = 0.07; P = 0.01), and folate (B = 0.08; 
      P = 0.02) were all positively and significantly associated with well-being in a 
      pregnant population. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to correct for multiple 
      testing was applied, and significance remained. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal nutrition and 
      well-being are related during early pregnancy. Our findings suggest that fiber, 
      magnesium, and particular B vitamins may be of importance for promoting positive 
      mental well-being during pregnancy.

      human skeletal muscle.
PG  - e13771

AB  - AIM: Hypoxia has been shown to reduce resistance exercise-induced stimulation of 
      protein synthesis and long-term gains in muscle mass. However, the mechanism whereby 
      hypoxia exerts its effect is not clear. Here, we examine the effect of acute hypoxia 
      on the activity of several signalling pathways involved in the regulation of muscle 
      growth following a bout of resistance exercise. METHODS: Eight men performed two 
      sessions of leg resistance exercise in normoxia or hypoxia (12% O(2) ) in a 
      randomized crossover fashion. Muscle biopsies were obtained at rest and 0, 
      90,180 minutes after exercise. Muscle analyses included levels of signalling 
      proteins and metabolites associated with energy turnover. RESULTS: Exercise during 
      normoxia induced a 5-10-fold increase of S6K1(Thr389) phosphorylation throughout the 
      recovery period, but hypoxia blunted the increases by ~50%. Phosphorylation of 
      JNK(Thr183/Tyr185) and the JNK target SMAD2(Ser245/250/255) was increased by 30- to 
      40-fold immediately after the exercise in normoxia, but hypoxia blocked almost 70% 
      of the activation. Throughout recovery, phosphorylation of JNK and SMAD2 remained 
      elevated following the exercise in normoxia, but the effect of hypoxia was lost at 
      90-180 minutes post-exercise. Hypoxia had no effect on exercise-induced Hippo or 
      autophagy signalling and ubiquitin-proteasome related protein levels. Nor did 
      hypoxia alter the changes induced by exercise in high-energy phosphates, glucose 
      6-P, lactate or phosphorylation of AMPK or ACC. CONCLUSION: We conclude that acute 
      severe hypoxia inhibits resistance exercise-induced mTORC1- and JNK signalling in 
      human skeletal muscle, effects that do not appear to be mediated by changes in the 
      degree of metabolic stress in the muscle.

AB  - de Freitas, MC, Cholewa, JM, Panissa, VLG, Toloi, GG, Netto, HC, Zanini de Freitas, 
      C, Freire, RV, Lira, FS, and Rossi, FE. Acute capsaicin supplementation improved 
      resistance exercise performance performed after a high-intensity intermittent 
      running in resistance-trained men. J Strength Cond Res 36(1): 130-134, 2022-We 
      sought to investigate the acute effects of capsaicin supplementation on the rate of 
      perceived exertion (RPE) and heart rate during high-intensity intermittent exercise 
      (HIIE) and resistance exercise performance executed after HIIE in resistance-trained 
      men. Eleven resistance-trained men completed 2 randomized, double-blind trials: 
      capsaicin condition or a placebo condition. The concurrent exercise session was 
      composed of a 5-km intermittent run (1:1 effort and passive recovery ratio) and 
      subsequent resistance exercise (4 × 70% of 1RM until muscle failure in the 
      half-squat exercise). Heart rate was recorded during HIIE and after the protocol RPE 
      (0-10 scale) was accessed. The resistance exercise performance was analyzed by the 
      maximum number of repetitions performed for each set and the total volume 
      (repetitions × weight lifted). During HIIE, the RPE (capsaicin = 7 ± 1 vs. placebo = 
      8 ± 1 points, t = -3.674, p = 0.005) and mean heart rate (capsaicin = 153 ± 13 vs. 
      placebo = 158 ± 12 bpm, t = -2.292, p = 0.048) were significantly lower in the 
      capsaicin compared with placebo condition. For subsequent resistance exercise, there 
      was a significant decrease in volume across time (F = 19.889, p < 0.001, η2= 0.69) 
      with maximal number of repetitions performed in capsaicin than placebo condition 
      (2,077.6 ± 465.2 kg vs. 1,838.9 ± 624.1 kg, p = 0.028, d = 0.43), but the condition 
      vs. set was not significant (F = 0.582, p = 0.632, η2= 0.06). Acute capsaicin 
      supplementation induced a lower mean heart rate and RPE during HIIE and improved 
      subsequent resistance exercise performance in resistance-trained men.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to summarize the evidence on the association 
      of phase angle (PhA) with muscle strength and aerobic fitness in different 
      populations. METHODS: A systematic search on this topic was performed in nine 
      electronic databases (CINAHL, LILACS, PubMed, SciELO, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, 
      ScienceDirect, MEDLINE, and Web of Science) in January 2021. Studies with different 
      designs that permitted extraction of information about the relationships between PhA 
      and muscle strength and between PhA and aerobic fitness were included. A total of 
      4446 studies were initially identified; 34 were included after reading of the title, 
      abstract, full text, and references. Four of the studies included had a longitudinal 
      design, with samples consisting of participants ages 6 to 92 years. Thirty-two of 
      the 34 studies evaluated the relationship between PhA and muscle strength, two 
      cross-sectional studies investigated only PhA and aerobic fitness, and three 
      cross-sectional studies evaluated both components (muscle strength and aerobic 
      fitness). RESULTS: PhA was directly associated with muscle strength in 30 
      cross-sectional studies and two longitudinal studies; the two studies that did not 
      find a direct relationship had a cross-sectional design. For aerobic fitness, the 
      five studies identified reported a direct relationship with PhA. CONCLUSIONS: PhA is 
      directly associated with muscle strength and aerobic fitness in different age groups 
      (children, adolescents, adults, and older adults) and in people with different 
      health conditions (human immunodeficiency virus, Crohn's disease, chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease, bariatric surgery, kidney transplant, cancer, 
      hemodialysis, and sarcopenia).

TI  - Healthy eating patterns and epigenetic measures of biological age.
PG  - 171-179
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/nqab307 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthy eating is associated with lower risks of disease and mortality, 
      but the mechanisms underlying these associations are unclear. Age is strongly 
      related to health outcomes, and biological age can be estimated using the blood 
      methylome. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether healthy eating patterns are associated 
      with methylation-based measures of biological age. METHODS: Among women in the 
      Sister Study, we calculated scores on 4 recommendation-based healthy eating indexes 
      [Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, Healthy Eating Index-2015, 
      Alternative Healthy Eating Index (aHEI-2010), and the Alternative Mediterranean 
      diet] using a validated 110-item Block FFQ completed at enrollment. Genome-wide DNA 
      methylation data were generated using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip on whole 
      blood samples collected at enrollment from a case-cohort sample of 2694 women and 
      were used to calculate 4 measures of epigenetic age acceleration (Hannum AgeAccel, 
      Horvath AgeAccel, PhenoAgeAccel, and GrimAgeAccel). Linear regression models, 
      adjusted for covariates and cohort sampling weights, were used to examine 
      cross-sectional associations between eating patterns and measures of biological age. 
      RESULTS: All 4 healthy eating indexes had inverse associations with epigenetic age 
      acceleration, most notably with PhenoAgeAccel and GrimAgeAccel. Of these, the 
      strongest associations were for aHEI-2010 [per 1-SD increase in diet quality, 
      PhenoAgeAccel β = -0.5 y (95% CI: -0.8 to -0.2 y) and GrimAgeAccel β = -0.4 y (95% 
      CI: -0.6 to -0.3 y)]. Although effect modification was not observed for most 
      lifestyle factors, in analyses stratified by physical activity, the benefits of a 
      healthy diet on epigenetic age acceleration were more pronounced among women who did 
      not meet physical activity guidelines (reporting <2.5 h/wk of exercise). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Higher diet quality is inversely associated with methylation-based 
      measures of biological age. Improving diet could have the most benefits in lowering 
      biological age among women with lower levels of physical activity. This trial was 
      registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00047970.

PG  - 100-106
LID - 10.1038/s41366-021-00963-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the influence of body weight, exercise 
      modality, and pace on physiological and perceptual responses to determine the 
      relation between perceptual and physiological responses. METHODS: Aerobically 
      untrained, normal weight, and overweight males and females participated. 
      Participants were randomly assigned to one exercise condition for a 1-mile walk. 
      RESULTS: Prescribed pace resulted in a greater physiological stress than 
      self-selected pace (all p < 0.001) through blood lactate (1.3 ± 0.4 vs 
      1.7 ± 0.5 mmol), systolic blood pressure (128.9 ± 10.3 vs 139.2 ± 13.2 mmHg), heart 
      rate recovery (2.1 ± 1.7 vs 4.5 ± 2.6 min), oxygen consumption (15.1 ± 2.6 vs 
      18.1 ± 3.6 ml/kg/min), heart rate (111.7 ± 16.6 vs 134.4 ± 8.3 bpm), and energy 
      expenditure (5.5 ± 1.4 vs 6.8 ± 1.7 kcal/min). Overweight individuals exhibited 
      higher values than normal weight for heart rate (113 ± 8.8 vs 125.5 ± 13.2 bpm, 
      p < 0.001), percentage of max heart rate (60.7 vs 69.0%, p < 0.001), percent of 
      VO(2)peak (42.2 vs 55.6%, p < 0.001), and total energy expenditure (100.9 ± 27.4 vs 
      114.1 ± 33.5 kcal, p = 0.022). Greater perceived effort was seen on a treadmill 
      (6.3 ± 0.5 vs 12.5 ± 2.0 RPE, p < 0.001) and at prescribed pace (6.5 ± 1.1 vs 
      8.9 ± 1.9 RPE, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: A novel finding of this study was the 
      increased physiological stress and perception of effort on a treadmill and at a 
      prescribed pace, while total energy expenditure showed no significant differences. 
      This could indicate an unfavorable perception and less affective response to the 
      treadmill modality. These results indicate exercise at self-selected pace in 
      preferred environments promotes enjoyable experiences with similar health benefits 
      as those during prescribed higher intensity exercise.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The long-term impact of physical activity during early life on the 
      risk of depression in later stages of adulthood remains unclear. This study examines 
      the association between physical activity during childhood and adolescence and the 
      incidence of depressive symptoms in early, middle, and late adulthood. METHODS: Data 
      from a birth cohort (the 1958 National Child Development Survey), including births 
      (N=17,415) in England, Wales, and Scotland, were used. After birth, 11 more 
      follow-ups were carried out between ages 7 and 62 years (2020). Leisure-time 
      physical activity was assessed through a self-reported questionnaire. Psychological 
      measures were assessed with the teacher-rated Bristol Social Adjustment Guide, the 
      teacher-rated Rutter scale, and the self-rated Malaise Inventory. Leisure-time 
      physical activity and psychological symptoms were examined in all the 11 follow-up 
      assessments included in this study. Best-fit model was used to obtain hazard ratios 
      and 95% CIs of depression symptoms by physical activity status in different ages, 
      including demographic, behavioral, and health-related variables as potential 
      confounders. RESULTS: After multivariate analysis, being physically active at age 16 
      years reduced the risk of incident elevated depressive symptoms (hazard ratio=0.73, 
      95% CI=0.62, 0.85) throughout adulthood. The long-term impacts of physical activity 
      practiced at age 16 years persisted throughout adulthood up to age 62 years. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Adolescence is a critical early-life period to promote physical 
      activity for reducing the incidence of elevated depressive symptoms throughout 
      adulthood. Public health policies should promote healthy lifestyles during the 
      lifespan to reduce both the burden of physical inactivity and depressive symptoms at 
      the population level.

AB  - Exercise, typically beneficial for skeletal health, has not yet been studied in 
      lipodystrophy, a condition characterized by paucity of white adipose tissue, with 
      eventual diabetes, and steatosis. We applied a mouse model of global deficiency of 
      Bscl2 (SEIPIN), required for lipid droplet formation. Male twelve-week-old B6 
      knockouts (KO) and wild type (WT) littermates were assigned six-weeks of voluntary, 
      running exercise (E) versus non-exercise (N=5-8). KO weighed 14% less than WT 
      (p=0.01) and exhibited an absence of epididymal adipose tissue; KO liver Plin1 via 
      qPCR was 9-fold that of WT (p=0.04), consistent with steatosis. Bone marrow adipose 
      tissue (BMAT), unlike white adipose, was measurable, although 40.5% lower in KO vs 
      WT (p=0.0003) via 9.4T MRI/advanced image analysis. SEIPIN ablation's most notable 
      effect marrow adiposity was in the proximal femoral diaphysis (-56% KO vs WT, 
      p=0.005), with relative preservation in KO-distal-femur. Bone via μCT was preserved 
      in SEIPIN KO, though some quality parameters were attenuated. Running distance, 
      speed, and time were comparable in KO and WT. Exercise reduced weight (-24% WT-E vs 
      WT p<0.001) but not in KO. Notably, exercise increased trabecular BV/TV in both 
      (+31%, KO-E vs KO, p=0.004; +14%, WT-E vs WT, p=0.006). The presence and 
      distribution of BMAT in SEIPIN KO, though lower than WT, is unexpected and points to 
      a uniqueness of this depot. That trabecular bone increases were achievable in both 
      KO and WT, despite a difference in BMAT quantity/distribution, points to potential 
      metabolic flexibility during exercise-induced skeletal anabolism.

AB  - Local district wellness policies are designed to ensure that schools support student 
      health by providing a healthy nutrition environment and opportunities for physical 
      activity. The Kansas State Department of Education (KSDE) developed a 5-year 
      initiative to strengthen wellness policies across their state by offering regional 
      wellness workshops and providing coaches to work with individual districts. KSDE 
      also developed the Wellness Impact Tool (WIT), a self-report measure districts use 
      to document their practices at each school level related to Nutrition, Nutrition 
      Promotion, Physical Activity, and Integrated School-Based Wellness. Kansas districts 
      (N = 286) completed the WIT annually over a 5-year period. The current study 
      evaluates the KSDE wellness initiative by examining the changes in WIT scores over 
      time and by school level, and testing whether greater engagement with wellness 
      supports (i.e., workshops attended and coaching sessions received) predicts higher 
      WIT scores. The findings indicate that district WIT scores increased over the 5-year 
      initiative. Overall, high schools scored higher than elementary or middle schools on 
      Nutrition items, and elementary schools scored higher than other school levels in 
      the domains of Nutrition Promotion, Physical Activity, and Integrated School-Based 
      Wellness. The number of wellness supports utilized by districts each year were 
      significant predictors of subsequent WIT scores. The KSDE's initiative to support 
      Kansas school districts was associated with significant improvements in the quality 
      of wellness practices across the state and provides a model for consideration by 
      other states.

TI  - Effect of a 3-Year Lifestyle Intervention in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease: A 
      Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 431-441
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2021050668 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Supervised lifestyle interventions have the potential to significantly 
      improve physical activity and fitness in patients with CKD. METHODS: To assess the 
      efficacy of a lifestyle intervention in patients with CKD to improve 
      cardiorespiratory fitness and exercise capacity over 36 months, we conducted a 
      randomized clinical trial, enrolling 160 patients with stage 3-4 CKD, with 81 
      randomized to usual care and 79 to a 3-year lifestyle intervention. The lifestyle 
      intervention comprised care from a multidisciplinary team, including a nephrologist, 
      nurse practitioner, exercise physiologist, dietitian, diabetes educator, 
      psychologist, and social worker. The exercise training component consisted of an 
      8-week individualized and supervised gym-based exercise intervention followed by 34 
      months of a predominantly home-based program. Self-reported physical activity 
      (metabolic equivalent of tasks [METs] minutes per week), cardiorespiratory fitness 
      (peak O(2) consumption [VO(2peak)]), exercise capacity (maximum METs and 6-minute 
      walk distance) and neuromuscular fitness (grip strength and get-up-and-go test time) 
      were evaluated at 12, 24, and 36 months. RESULTS: The intervention increased the 
      percentage of patients meeting physical activity guideline targets of 500 MET min/wk 
      from 29% at baseline to 63% at 3 years. At 12 months, both VO(2peak) and METs 
      increased significantly in the lifestyle intervention group by 9.7% and 30%, 
      respectively, without change in the usual care group. Thereafter, VO(2peak) declined 
      to near baseline levels, whereas METs remained elevated in the lifestyle 
      intervention group at 24 and 36 months. After 3 years, the intervention had 
      increased the 6-minute walk distance and blunted declines in the get-up-and-go test 
      time. CONCLUSIONS: A 3-year lifestyle intervention doubled the percentage of CKD 
      patients meeting physical activity guidelines, improved exercise capacity, and 
      ameliorated losses in neuromuscular and cardiorespiratory fitness.

TI  - What interventions affect the psychosocial burden experienced by prostate cancer 
      patients undergoing active surveillance? A scoping review.
LID - 10.1007/s00520-022-06830-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Living with untreated prostate cancer (PCa) may cause anxiety and 
      uncertainty in men undergoing active surveillance (AS). Developing a psychosocial 
      support program for such patients might promote psychosocial well-being and patient 
      engagement. This review aims to identify interventions with the potential to 
      influence the psychosocial burden of prostate cancer patients undergoing AS. 
      METHODS: A scoping review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA Extension for 
      Scoping Reviews Checklist. A systematic search was conducted in six databases and 
      included publications dating from 2009. All available and eligible evidence was 
      included in this review. RESULTS: After screening 2824 articles, 12 studies were 
      included in the review: nine quantitative, one qualitative, and two mixed method 
      papers. The relative strength of these studies was limited and the quality of most 
      was moderate. CONCLUSIONS: The described interventions can be categorized into three 
      major themes: information and education, coping and (psycho)social support, and 
      lifestyle. Psychosocial support for men undergoing AS should entail involvement of 
      family and spouse during the decision-making process, tailored information about PCa 
      treatments, risks, benefits, protocols, lifestyle adjustments, and complementary and 
      alternative medicine. Assessment and promotion of effective coping and 
      self-management strategies are recommended. Healthcare providers should actively 
      promote physical activity and nutritional improvements. Physical activity programs 
      may also be helpful in facilitating peer support, which is especially important for 
      men with limited social support. Future research should investigate combining 
      interventions to increase efficacy and optimize supportive care during AS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study assessed associations between antenatal physical activity and 
      the onset of spontaneous labor (SL). METHODS: Data were taken from 541 participants 
      in the third pregnancy, infection, and nutrition study who had no contraindications 
      to antenatal physical activity. An interviewer-administered questionnaire assessed 
      labor triggers, gestational age at birth, and physical activity within the week 
      (24 h to 7 d) and the 24-hour period (0-24 h) prior to SL. A case-crossover design 
      examined the association between physical activity (recreational, occupational, or 
      any) and the risk of onset of SL within the subsequent 24 hours. RESULTS: Overall, 
      21% (any), 26% (recreational), and 14% (occupational) of participants reported 
      physical activity during the week; whereas 5% (any), 7% (recreational), and 3% 
      (occupational) reported physical activity during the 24-hour period, prior to SL 
      onset. Participants who reported any or occupational physical activity during the 
      24-hour period had a decreased likelihood of SL within the subsequent 24 hours, 
      while participants who reported at least 30 minutes of recreational physical 
      activity had an increased likelihood. Results remained consistent among early, full, 
      or postterm participants. CONCLUSION: Recreational, but not occupational, physical 
      activity at term may increase the likelihood of SL; however, the authors cannot rule 
      out reverse causality.

TI  - Anamorelin combined with physical activity, and nutritional counseling for 
      cancer-related fatigue: a preliminary study.
PG  - 497-509
LID - 10.1007/s00520-021-06463-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is the most frequent and debilitating symptom 
      in patients with advanced cancer. There are limited effective treatments for CRF. 
      The objective of this prospective longitudinal study was to evaluate the change in 
      CRF at Day 43 after treatment with combination therapy of oral Anamorelin 100 mg 
      daily with physical activity and nutrition counseling. METHODS: In this study, 
      patients with CRF [≤ 34 Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue 
      subscales(FACIT-F)] received Anamorelin 100 mg orally daily with standardized 
      physical activity and nutrition counseling for 43 days. Functional Assessment of 
      Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), Anorexia Cachexia(FAACT-ACS), 
      Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form(MFSI-SF), Patient-Reported 
      Outcomes Measurement Information System(PROMIS-Fatigue), body composition, and 
      physical performance tests were assessed at baseline, Day 15, 29, and 43. Frequency 
      and type of side effects were determined by NCI CTAE 4.0.(NCT03035409). RESULTS: 
      28/45 (62%) of patients dosed were evaluable at Day 43. The mean, SD for FACIT-F 
      subscale improvement from baseline was 4.89 (± 13.07), P = .058, MFSI-SF (G) - 3.46 
      (± 6.86), P = 0.013, PROMIS-fatigue - 4.14 (± 7.88), P = 0.010, FAACT ACS 3.48 
      (± 8.13), P = 0.035. Godin Liesure-Time physical activity questionnaire 7.41 
      (± 16.50), P = 0.038. Weight (kg) 1.81 (± 2.63), P = 0.005, and Lean Body Mass 1.54 
      (± 1.85), P = 0.001, IGF-1 36.50 (± 48.76), P = 0.015. There was no significant 
      improvement in physical performance outcomes. No adverse events > grade 3 related to 
      the study drug were reported. CONCLUSION: The use of the combination therapy was 
      associated with improvement of CRF (FACIT-F fatigue, PROMIS-fatigue, 
      MFSI-SF-general), activity (Godin-leisure time), anorexia (FAACT), body composition, 
      and IGF-1 levels. Further studies using combination therapy for CRF are justified.

TI  - The global approach to rehabilitation following an osteoporotic fragility fracture: 
      A review of the rehabilitation working group of the International Osteoporosis 
      Foundation (IOF) committee of scientific advisors.
PG  - 527-540
LID - 10.1007/s00198-021-06240-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To conduct a review of the current state of the evidence for rehabilitation 
      strategies post-fragility fracture. METHODS: Narrative review conducted by the 
      Rehabilitation Working Group of the International Osteoporosis Foundation Committee 
      of Scientific Advisors characterizing the range of rehabilitation modalities 
      instrumental for the management of fragility fractures. RESULTS: Multi-modal 
      exercise post-fragility fracture to the spine and hip is strongly recommended to 
      reduce pain, improve physical function, and improve quality of life. Outpatient 
      physiotherapy post-hip fracture has a stronger evidence base than outpatient 
      physiotherapy post-vertebral fracture. Appropriate nutritional care after fragility 
      fracture provides a large range of improvement in morbidity and mortality. Education 
      increases understanding of osteoporosis which in turn increases utilization of other 
      rehabilitation services. Education may improve other health outcomes such as pain 
      and increase a patient's ability for self-advocacy. CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation 
      interventions are inter-reliant, and research investigating the interaction of 
      exercise, nutrition, and other multi-modal therapies may increase the relevance of 
      rehabilitation research to clinical care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the implementation of a multicomponent survivorship programme 
      for men with prostate cancer and their carers. DESIGN: A single cohort study, guided 
      by the RE-AIM framework. SETTING: Multiple health services in Australia. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Men with prostate cancer and their carers, and health professionals. 
      INTERVENTION: A 12-month telehealth programme that provided centralised and 
      coordinated decision and information support, exercise and nutrition management, 
      specialised clinical support and practical support to men and their carers. DATA 
      COLLECTION: Multiple sources of data including participant-reported health outcomes 
      and experience of care, qualitative interviews, records of the programme were 
      collected at different time points. RESULTS: Reach: Of 394 eligible men at various 
      stages of survivorship, 142 consented (36% consent rate) and 136 (96%) completed the 
      programme. Adoption: All men participated in general care coordination and more than 
      half participated in exercise and/or nutrition management interventions. 
      Participation in the specialised support component (ie, psychosocial and sexual 
      health support, continence management) was low despite the high level of need 
      reported by men. Effectiveness: Overall, the men reported improvements in their 
      experience of care. Implementation: Factors such as addressing service gaps, 
      provision of specialised services, care coordination, adoption of needs-based and 
      telehealth-based approaches were identified as enablers to the successful 
      implementation of the programme. Issues such as insufficient integration with 
      existing services, lack of resources and high caseload of the intervention team, 
      men's reluctance to discuss needs and lack of confidence with technology were 
      barriers in implementing the programme. CONCLUSION: Survivorship interventions are 
      relevant to men regardless of the stage of their disease and treatments undertaken. 
      It is possible to provide access to a comprehensive model of survivorship care to 
      promote the health and quality of life for men with prostate cancer. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION NUMBER: This study was registered with the Australian and New Zealand 
      Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12617000174381).

TI  - Changes in plasma concentration of kynurenine following intake of branched-chain 
      amino acids are not caused by alterations in muscle kynurenine metabolism.
PG  - C49-C62
LID - 10.1152/ajpcell.00285.2021 [doi]
AB  - Administration of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) has been suggested to enhance 
      mitochondrial biogenesis, including levels of PGC-1α, which may, in turn, alter 
      kynurenine metabolism. Ten healthy subjects performed 60 min of dynamic one-leg 
      exercise at ∼70% of W(max) on two occasions. They were in random order supplied 
      either a mixture of BCAA or flavored water (placebo) during the experiment. Blood 
      samples were collected during exercise and recovery, and muscle biopsies were taken 
      from both legs before, after, and 90 and 180 min following exercise. Ingestion of 
      BCAA doubled their concentration in both plasma and muscle while causing a 30%-40% 
      reduction (P < 0.05 vs. placebo) in levels of aromatic amino acids in both resting 
      and exercising muscle during 3-h recovery period. The muscle concentration of 
      kynurenine decreased by 25% (P < 0.05) during recovery, similar in both resting and 
      exercising leg and with both supplements, although plasma concentration of 
      kynurenine during recovery was 10% lower (P < 0.05) when BCAA were ingested. 
      Ingestion of BCAA reduced the plasma concentration of kynurenic acid by 60% (P < 
      0.01) during exercise and recovery, whereas the level remained unchanged with 
      placebo. Exercise induced a three- to fourfold increase (P < 0.05) in muscle content 
      of PGC-1α1 mRNA after 90 min of recovery under both conditions, whereas levels of 
      KAT4 mRNA and protein were unaffected by exercise or supplement. In conclusion, the 
      reduction of plasma levels of kynurenine and kynurenic acid caused by BCAA were not 
      associated with any changes in the level of muscle kynurenine, suggesting that 
      kynurenine metabolism was altered in tissues other than muscle.

TI  - Finding a rhythm: Relating ultra-short-term heart rate variability measures in 
      healthy young adults during rest, exercise, and recovery.

AB  - Ultra-short-term (UST; <5 min) heart rate variability (HRV) is increasingly used to 
      indirectly assess autonomic nervous system modulation and physical health. However, 
      UST HRV estimates may vary with measurement technique, physiological state, and data 
      preprocessing. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the information 
      content of UST HRV and its sensitivity to different physiological states and 
      preprocessing techniques. 26 time, frequency, and non-linear HRV measures were 
      determined in 80 healthy men (age: 22.1 ± 3.7 yr) and 25 women (age: 19.4 ± 2.8 yr) 
      from 2-min ECG recordings during seated and standing rest, low-intensity exercise, 
      and seated recovery after maximal exercise. For men, HRV measures obtained during 
      each condition were further analyzed with principal component analysis, k-means 
      clustering, and one-way ANCOVAs. Backward stepwise regression was used to determine 
      the ability of UST HRV to predict aerobic fitness. The sensitivity of UST HRV 
      estimates to different artifact correction procedures was determined with intraclass 
      correlation coefficients. Compared with men, women displayed HRV characteristics 
      suggestive of greater vagal modulation. Nearly 80% of HRV information content was 
      distilled into three principal components comprised of similar measures across 
      conditions. K-means clusters varied in composition and HRV characteristics but not 
      aerobic fitness, which was best predicted by HRV during standing rest. HRV estimates 
      differed depending on artifact correction procedures but were generally similar 
      after individualized correction. Our results indicate that UST HRV measures display 
      redundancy but convey state-specific information and do not strongly predict aerobic 
      fitness in healthy men. Most UST HRV measures are robust to slight differences in 
      artifact correction procedures.

TI  - Outdoor public recreation spaces and social connectedness among adolescents.
PG  - 165

LID - 165
AB  - BACKGROUND: Outdoor public recreation spaces are important settings for leisure and 
      physical activity. Adolescents' use of these spaces may contribute to social 
      connectedness via social interaction with peers and the community in these settings. 
      However, research on this topic is limited. This exploratory study examined 
      associations of frequency of visitation and physical activity in outdoor public 
      recreation spaces with social connectedness among adolescents in Melbourne, 
      Australia. METHODS: Adolescents self-reported their frequency of visitation to 
      parks, trails, beach/lake, and sports facilities; frequency of physical activity in 
      a park, local street or path, and their street; and social connectedness. Separate 
      analyses were conducted for visitation (n = 349, 15.4 ± 1.6 years, 58% female) and 
      physical activity (n = 441, 15.4 ± 1.6 years, 59% female) using multilevel linear 
      regression models. RESULTS: No significant associations were observed for frequency 
      of visitation to a park (B = 0.86, 95% CI = - 0.26, 1.99), trails (B = 0.41, 95% 
      CI = - 0.61, 1.44), beach/lake (B = - 0.44, 95% CI = - 1.46, 0.57), or sports 
      facilities (B = 0.64, 95% CI = - 0.43, 1.70), nor for frequency of physical activity 
      in their street (B = - 0.07, 95% CI = - 0.46, 0.31), local street/path (B = - 0.05, 
      95% CI = - 0.43, 0.33) or in a park (B = 0.23, 95% CI = - 0.14, 0.60) with 
      adolescents' social connectedness. CONCLUSIONS: The findings did not support the 
      hypothesis that visiting and being active in outdoor public recreation spaces are 
      associated with adolescents' social connectedness. Future research should consider 
      the duration and context of outdoor public recreation space use (e.g., sports, 
      socialising, relaxing alone) and whether different types and/or a combination of 
      public spaces are more/less conducive to social connectedness.

TI  - The Path Towards Progress: A Critical Review to Advance the Science of the Female 
      and Male Athlete Triad and Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport.

AB  - Energy status plays a key role in the health of athletes and exercising individuals. 
      Energy deficiency/low energy availability (EA), referring to a state in which 
      insufficient energy intake and/or excessive exercise energy expenditure has resulted 
      in compensatory metabolic adaptations to conserve fuel, can affect numerous 
      physiological systems in women and men. The Female Athlete Triad, Male Athlete 
      Triad, and Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-S) models conceptualize the 
      effects of energy deficiency in athletes, and each model has strengths and 
      limitations. For instance, the Female Athlete Triad model depicts relationships 
      between low EA, reproductive, and bone health, underpinning decades of experimental 
      evidence, but may be perceived as limited in scope, while the more recent RED-S 
      model proposes a wider range of potential health effects of low EA, though many 
      model components require more robust scientific justification. This critical review 
      summarizes current evidence regarding the effects of energy deficiency on athlete 
      health by addressing the quality of the underlying science, the strengths and 
      limitations of each model, and highlighting areas where future research is needed to 
      advance the field. With the health and wellness of athletes and exercising 
      individuals as the overarching priority, we conclude with specific steps that will 
      help focus future research on the Female and Male Athlete Triad and RED-S, and 
      encourage all researchers, clinicians, and practitioners to collaborate to support 
      the common goal of promoting the highest quality science and evidence-based medicine 
      in pursuit of the advancement of athletes' health, well-being, and performance.

TI  - Practice review: Evidence-based and effective management of fatigue in patients with 
      advanced cancer.
PG  - 7-14

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue affects most patients living with advanced cancer and is a 
      symptom that healthcare professionals can find difficult to manage. AIM: To provide 
      healthcare professionals with a pragmatic overview of approaches to management of 
      fatigue in patients with advanced cancer that are commonly recommended by guidelines 
      and to evaluate evidence underpinning them. DESIGN: Scoping review methodology was 
      used to determine the strength of evidence supporting use of interventions 
      recommended in management of fatigue in patients with advanced cancer. DATA SOURCES: 
      National or international guidelines were examined if they described the management 
      of fatigue in adult cancer patients and were written within the last 6 years 
      (2015-2021) in English. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (January 
      2011-December 2021) was searched for 'cancer' AND 'fatigue' in title, abstract or 
      keywords. A PubMed search was also made. RESULTS: Evidence indicates physical 
      exercise interventions are effective and patients may benefit from energy 
      conservation tactics. Evidence does not support use of psychostimulants such as 
      methylphenidate. Limited data were found on efficacy of corticosteroids, 
      psychological interventions, nutritional intervention, sleep optimization or 
      complementary therapies for management of fatigue in advanced cancer. CONCLUSION: We 
      recommend regular assessment, review and acknowledgement of the impact of fatigue. 
      Exercise and energy conservation should be considered. Pharmacological interventions 
      are not endorsed as a routine approach. Many interventions currently recommended by 
      guidelines are not supported by a robust evidence base and further research on their 
      efficacy is required.

TI  - Patient activation and patient-reported outcomes of men from a community pharmacy 
      lifestyle intervention after prostate cancer treatment.
PG  - 347-358
LID - 10.1007/s00520-021-06404-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To report patient activation, which is the knowledge, skills, and 
      confidence in self-managing health conditions, and patient-reported outcomes of men 
      after prostate cancer treatment from a community pharmacy lifestyle intervention. 
      METHODS: The 3-month lifestyle intervention was delivered to 116 men in nine 
      community pharmacies in the UK. Patient Activation Measure (PAM) was assessed at 
      baseline, 3 and 6 months. Prostate cancer-related function and quality of life were 
      assessed using the European Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) and EuroQOL 
      5-dimension 5-level (EQ5D-5L) questionnaires at baseline and 6 months. Lifestyle 
      assessments included Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) at baseline, 3 
      and 6 months and Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) at baseline and 
      3 months. RESULTS: PAM score increased from 62 [95% CI 59-65] at baseline to 66 
      [64-69] after the intervention (p = 0.001) and remained higher at 6 months 
      (p = 0.008). Scores for all the EPIC-26 domains (urinary, bowel and hormonal) were 
      high at both assessments, indicating good function (between 74 [70-78] and 89 
      [86-91]), except sexual domain, where scores were much lower (21 [17-25] at 
      baseline, increasing to 24 [20-28] at 6 months (p = 0.012)). In EQ5D-5L, 3% of men 
      [1-9] reported self-care problems, while 50% [41-60] reported pain and discomfort, 
      and no significant changes over time. Men who received androgen deprivation therapy, 
      compared with those who did not, reported higher (better) urinary incontinence 
      scores (p < 0.001), but lower (worse) scores in the urinary irritative/obstructive 
      (p = 0.003), bowel (p < 0.001) and hormonal (p < 0.001) domains. Poor sexual 
      function was common across all age groups irrespective of prostate cancer treatment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The intervention led to significant improvements in patient activation, 
      exercise and diet. Community pharmacy could deliver effective services to address 
      sexual dysfunction, pain and discomfort which are common after prostate cancer.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Cardiac rehabilitation has the highest level of 
      recognition in medical guideline references. The rise of COVID-19 pandemic, 
      particularly during the first months of strict containment, cause to temporally stop 
      most of the ongoing programs. We studied the effects of an interdisciplinary phase 
      II secondary prevention in patients diagnosed with a recent acute coronary syndrome 
      with the use of new technologies, home-exercise and telemedicine. METHODS: Between 
      the 2nd and 11th of March 2020, we included 37 patients with recent acute coronary 
      syndrome (76.4%), low-risk and preserved systolic function and underwent a 12-week 
      treatment. A dynamic muscle toning with overload domiciliary training program was 
      applied, in addition to nutritional counselling, as well as psychological and 
      educational therapy. RESULTS: Of the initial cohort, 30 patients finished. At the 
      end of the program, we observed and increased functional capacity over the 6-min 
      walking test (+47.13m; 95% CI: 32.82-61.45, P<.001), and improvement to the 
      subjective feeling of dyspnoea on the modified Borg scale (-0.5 units; 95% CI: -0.76 
      to -0.24, P=.001), and an improvement over both initial and final training systolic 
      blood pressure (-6.67mmHg; 95% CI: -10.98 to -2.35, P=.004) (-7mmHg; 95% CI: -12.86 
      to -1.14, P=.021). We also observed an increase in the level of physical activity 
      during leisure time in the IPAQ questionnaire (+1162.93min/week; 95% CI: 
      237.36-2088.5, P=.016), and in the Mediterranean eating habits on the PREDIMED test 
      (+2.1units; 95% CI: 1.32-2.28, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: After three months of a 
      domiciliary cardiac rehabilitation program, patients increased their functional 
      capacity, feeling of dyspnoea, blood pressure and eating habits. Domiciliary 
      telemedicine cardiac rehabilitation program produces an improvement in the patient 
      after acute coronary syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The obesity epidemic continues to be a major public health concern. 
      Although exercise is the most common weight loss recommendation, weight loss 
      outcomes from an exercise program are often suboptimal. The human body compensates 
      for a large percentage of the energy expended through exercise to maintain energy 
      homeostasis and body weight. Increases in energy intake appear to be the most 
      impactful compensatory behavior. Research on the mechanisms driving this behavior 
      has not been fully elucidated. PURPOSE: To determine if exercise influences the 
      attentional processing towards food cues (attentional bias) and inhibitory control 
      for food cues among individuals classified as overweight to obese who do not 
      exercise. METHODS: Thirty adults classified as overweight to obese participated in a 
      counterbalanced, crossover trial featuring two assessment visits on separate days 
      separated by at least one week. Attentional bias and inhibitory control towards food 
      cues was assessed prior to and after a bout of exercise where participants expended 
      500 kcal (one assessment visit) and before and after a 60 min bout of watching 
      television (second assessment visit). Attentional bias was conceptualized as the 
      percentage of time fixated on food cues when both food and neutral (non-food) cues 
      were presented during a food-specific dot-probe task. Inhibitory control, 
      specifically motor impulsivity, was assessed as percentage of inhibitory failures 
      during a food-specific Go/NoGo task. RESULTS: A significant condition by time effect 
      was observed for attentional bias towards food cues, independent of hunger, whereas 
      attentional bias towards food cues was increased pre-post exercise but not after 
      watching TV. Inhibitory control was not affected by exercise or related to 
      attentional bias for food cues. CONCLUSIONS: An acute bout of exercise increased 
      attentional bias for food cues, pointing to a mechanism that may contribute to the 
      weight loss resistance observed with exercise. Future trials are needed to evaluate 
      attentional bias towards food cues over a longitudinal exercise intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim was to analyze the associations between multiple lifestyle 
      behaviors and depressive symptoms. METHODS: We included 4,725 adults (18-59y), that 
      provided data in routine health evaluations of a hospital in Brazil, followed for a 
      mean period of 3.1 ± 1.6 years. Physical activity, alcohol consumption (measured 
      using Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) and tobacco smoking were 
      categorized as: (1) absence of the behavior (inactivity i.e. not complying with 
      150 min of moderate-to-vigorous PA/week, not smoking, no risky drinking, i.e. 
      AUDIT<5) during baseline and follow-up; (2) Absence during baseline and presence 
      during follow-up; (3) Presence during baseline and absence during follow-up; (4) 
      Presence during both time points. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Beck 
      Inventory was adopted to analyze patterns of depressive symptoms over time (as 
      exposure). C-reactive protein [HS-CRP]) was assessed and its role in the association 
      was tested. Incidence indicators of behaviors and depressive symptoms were created 
      and used as outcomes. We used crude and adjusted Poisson regression analysis. 
      RESULTS: Fully adjusted models revealed that persistently physical inactive 
      participants (RR:1.71;95%CI:1.33-2.21), those who became physically inactive 
      (1.68;1.19-2.26), with consistently risky drinking (1.62;1.15-2.30), and who became 
      risky drinkers (1.62;1.15-2.30) had higher risk for incidence of elevated depressive 
      symptoms. Vice versa participants with incidence of depressive symptoms over time 
      presented higher risk for physical inactivity (1.44;1.11-1.87) and risky drinking 
      (1.65;1.16-2.34) incidence. HS-CRP did not influence the associations. LIMITATIONS: 
      Self-reported physical activity, binary tobacco smoking, and non-probabilistic 
      sampling. CONCLUSIONS: There is a prospective relationship between elevated 
      depressive symptoms and adverse lifestyle behaviors.

TI  - Depression and Anxiety Are Associated with Physical Performance in Patients 
      Undergoing Cardiac Rehabilitation: A Retrospective Observational Study.
LID - 10.3390/jcdd9010021 [doi]
LID - 21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) combined with stress management training has 
      been shown to be associated with fewer clinical events than CR alone. However, there 
      have been no reports on the associations of CR with the psychological condition and 
      detailed physical activities evaluated on the same day. METHOD: One hundred 
      outpatients who participated in a CR program were graded on the hospital anxiety and 
      depression scale (HADS). We divided them into a high HADS group (n = 32) and a 
      normal HADS group (n = 68) and investigated by whole patients, ischemic heart 
      disease (IHD) patients, and heart failure patients. RESULTS: Overall, the patient 
      age was 70.5 ± 9.6 years, the percentage of males was 73.0%, and the body mass index 
      was 23.4 (21.7-26.0) kg/m(2). In the high HADS group, overall functional mobility 
      was poor and the distance in a two-minute walking test was short. Especially in IHD 
      patients, the high HADS group showed high fat mass in body composition and low 
      exercise tolerance and ventilator equivalents in cardiopulmonary exercise test. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Depression and anxiety involved poor physical performance in CR 
      outpatients and particularly involved low exercise tolerance in IHD patients. To 
      evaluate accurate physical performance, it is necessary to investigate psychological 
      condition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer defined as cancer of the colon or rectum, is the third 
      most frequently diagnosed cancer in men and the second in women, and, according to 
      the World Health Organization database GLOBOCAN, it accounts for nearly 1.4 million 
      new cases annually worldwide. The occurrence of colorectal cancer is associated with 
      nonmodifiable risk factors, including age and hereditary factors, as well as with 
      modifiable environmental and lifestyle factors. METHODS: The study included 800 
      patients, 400 diagnosed with colorectal cancer and 400 within the control group, who 
      gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. Patients with 
      cancer other than colorectal cancer were randomly selected for control group I, and 
      patients with no cancer diagnosis were selected for control group II. The method 
      used was a case-control study - an observational and analytical study with a control 
      group, conducted among patients of the Clinical Oncology Centre and the Provincial 
      Hospital in the years 2019-2020. The study comparing the exposure was carried out in 
      a group of people who developed the endpoint, that is colorectal cancer, with the 
      exposure in a well-matched group of controls who did not reach the endpoint. 
      Assessment of activity and BMI was used according to WHO recommendations, as well as 
      the expert system. The data were tested for the distribution and the homogeneity of 
      variance was validated before applying the parameter tests. Comparison of 
      quantitative variables between groups was performed using ANOVA. RESULTS: The mean 
      age of the patients was 64.53 ± 8.86 years, of the control group I - 59.64 ± 9.33 
      and the control group II - 57.5 (7.83). There was a strong positive association 
      between the incidence of ulcerative colitis and the risk of colorectal cancer (P < 
      .01). Among obese subjects, the risk of developing colorectal cancer was 1.27 (95% 
      CI, 1.06-1.53) compared with nonobese subjects. A strong positive relationship was 
      found between low physical activity converted to metabolic equivalent of MET effort 
      per week and the risk of colorectal cancer (P < .001). The relative risk for current 
      smokers was 2.17 (95% CI 1.79-2.66). There was an association between higher fat 
      consumption and higher red meat consumption and the risk of developing colorectal 
      cancer (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity, low physical activity, active and passive 
      smoking and high salt and red meat consumption have been associated with an 
      increased risk of colorectal cancer. These findings provide further evidence of the 
      importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

TI  - Digital Intervention Strategies for Increasing Physical Activity Among Preschoolers: 
      Systematic Review.
PG  - e28230
LID - 10.2196/28230 [doi]
LID - e28230
AB  - BACKGROUND: Digital interventions are increasingly used to improve health behaviors. 
      Improved access and lower costs (relative to in-person interventions) make such 
      interventions appealing. Specifically, digital platforms may be a promising approach 
      for increasing physical activity (PA) in young children. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this 
      systematic review was three-pronged: (1) to determine the quality of studies using 
      digital PA intervention strategies with preschool-aged children (ie, 3 to 5 years 
      old); (2) to assess the efficacy of digital interventions and approaches designed to 
      improve PA in preschool-aged children; and (3) to examine theoretical application 
      and implementation outcomes with current approaches to digital PA interventions. 
      METHODS: This review identified and summarized studies on digitally supported 
      interventions for promoting PA in preschool-aged children. We generated 3 lists of 
      relevant search terms that included technology-related terms, PA-related terms, and 
      weight-related terms. The search included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, 
      In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, and Daily, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane 
      Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 
      and Scopus. Study selection was led by a single author and verified by a second; the 
      same 2 authors assessed study quality using a standardized tool, and 3 authors 
      completed data extraction on PA outcomes, theory application, and implementation 
      outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 601 studies were identified; 8 met the inclusion 
      criteria. For study quality, only 2 studies received an overall rating of strong 
      quality and low risk of bias. All but 1 study had a small sample size (<100). 
      Positive and significant changes in child PA outcomes were reported in only 2 
      studies with weak overall quality, both of which used child-directed approaches. In 
      total, 5 studies applied a behavioral theory for designing the intervention; no 
      patterns of effectiveness were identified based on the application of theory. 
      Finally, no studies reported on the implementation outcomes of adoption, cost, 
      penetration, or sustainability; 1 study did not assess any implementation outcomes, 
      and no single study reported on more than 2 implementation outcomes. Studies 
      measured the implementation outcome of acceptability most frequently (n=4), and 
      researchers assessed fidelity in 3 studies. CONCLUSIONS: The interventions with a 
      significant effect on PA used child-centered activities; parent-directed digital 
      interventions alone were ineffective for improving PA. Future research with rigorous 
      designs, monitoring of implementation outcomes, and testing of the contributions of 
      digital components will advance understanding of the effectiveness of digital 
      interventions for increasing PA in children.

TI  - Plant-based diets and incident cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in 
      African Americans: A cohort study.
PG  - e1003863
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1003863 [doi]
LID - e1003863
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior studies have documented lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk 
      among people with a higher adherence to a plant-based dietary pattern. Non-Hispanic 
      black Americans are an understudied group with high burden of CVD, yet studies of 
      plant-based diets have been limited in this population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We 
      conducted an analysis of prospectively collected data from a community-based cohort 
      of African American adults (n = 3,635) in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) aged 21-95 
      years, living in the Jackson, Mississippi, metropolitan area, US, who were followed 
      from 2000 to 2018. Using self-reported dietary data, we assigned scores to 
      participants' adherence to 3 plant-based dietary patterns: an overall plant-based 
      diet index (PDI), a healthy PDI (hPDI), and an unhealthy PDI (uPDI). Cox 
      proportional hazards models were used to estimate associations between plant-based 
      diet scores and CVD incidence and all-cause mortality. Over a median follow-up of 13 
      and 15 years, there were 293 incident CVD cases and 597 deaths, respectively. After 
      adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, and education) and health 
      behaviors (smoking, alcohol intake, margarine intake, physical activity, and total 
      energy intake), no significant association was observed between plant-based diets 
      and incident CVD for overall PDI (hazard ratio [HR] 1.06, 95% CI 0.78-1.42, p-trend 
      = 0.72), hPDI (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.80-1.42, p-trend = 0.67), and uPDI (HR 0.95, 95% CI 
      0.71-1.28, p-trend = 0.76). Corresponding HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality risk 
      with overall PDI, hPDI, and uPDI were 0.96 (0.78-1.18), 0.94 (0.76-1.16), and 1.06 
      (0.86-1.30), respectively. Corresponding HRs (95% CIs) for incident coronary heart 
      disease with overall PDI, hPDI, and uPDI were 1.09 (0.74-1.61), 1.11 (0.76-1.61), 
      and 0.79 (0.52-1.18), respectively. For incident total stroke, HRs (95% CIs) for 
      overall PDI, hPDI, and uPDI were 1.00 (0.66-1.52), 0.91 (0.61-1.36), and 1.26 
      (0.84-1.89) (p-trend for all tests > 0.05). Limitations of the study include use of 
      self-reported dietary intake, residual confounding, potential for reverse causation, 
      and that the study did not capture those who exclusively consume plant-derived 
      foods. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of black Americans, we observed that, unlike in 
      prior studies, greater adherence to a plant-based diet was not associated with CVD 
      or all-cause mortality.

TI  - Sarcopenia in Chronic Kidney Disease: A Scoping Review of Prevalence, Risk Factors, 
      Association with Outcomes, and Treatment.
PG  - 1-31
LID - 10.1007/s00223-021-00898-1 [doi]
AB  - Sarcopenia, a condition characterized by loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, 
      has important clinical ramifications. We aimed to map the existing literature about 
      prevalence, risk factors, associated adverse outcomes, and treatment of sarcopenia 
      in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD). A scoping review of the literature 
      was conducted to identify relevant articles published from databases' inception to 
      September 2019. Individuals with CKD, regardless of their disease stage and their 
      comorbidities, were included. Only studies with sarcopenia diagnosed using both 
      muscle mass and function, based on published consensus definitions, were included. 
      For studies on treatment, only randomized controlled trials with at least one 
      sarcopenia parameter as an outcome were included. Our search yielded 1318 articles, 
      of which 60 from were eligible for this review. The prevalence of sarcopenia ranged 
      from 4 to 42% according to the definition used, population studied, and the disease 
      stage. Several risk factors for sarcopenia were identified including age, male 
      gender, low BMI, malnutrition, and high inflammatory status. Sarcopenia was found to 
      be associated with several adverse outcomes, including disabilities, 
      hospitalizations, and mortality. In CKD subjects, several therapeutic interventions 
      have been assessed in randomized controlled trial with a muscle mass, strength, or 
      function endpoint, however, studies focusing on sarcopenic CKD individuals are 
      lacking. The key interventions in the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia in CKD 
      seem to be aerobic and resistance exercises along with nutritional interventions. 
      Whether these interventions are effective to treat sarcopenia and prevent clinical 
      consequences in this population remains to be fully determined.

TI  - Cancer survivors' perspectives of dietary information provision after cancer 
      treatment: A scoping review of the Australian context.
PG  - 232-244
LID - 10.1002/hpja.496 [doi]
AB  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: To support survivor-centred care in Australia, this review maps 
      current knowledge regarding adult cancer survivors' perspectives of dietary 
      information provision post-treatment. METHODS: A scoping review of research 
      conducted in Australia within the past decade reported using PRISMA-ScR guidelines. 
      Seven databases were searched (01/01/2009-05/06/2020) and records were independently 
      screened by two researchers using eligibility criteria. Papers in the peer-reviewed 
      literature with dietary information post-treatment as a primary and secondary 
      outcome were eligible for inclusion. Data charting included participant 
      characteristics, study methodology and cancer survivors' reports of dietary 
      information provision post-treatment. RESULTS: Of 531 records identified, 12 met 
      eligibility criteria. Most studies included breast (58%) and colorectal (42%) cancer 
      survivors within 5 years post-diagnosis (84%). Three studies were conducted amongst 
      specific ethnic groups (Indigenous Australians, Chinese-Australians, 
      Greek-Australians). Participants in the included studies commonly reported limited 
      or ineffective dietary information from healthcare providers post-treatment. Cancer 
      survivors identified a need for individualised information regarding dietary 
      strategies to manage ongoing symptoms, professional support for weight management, 
      and practical skills for healthy eating. Amongst ethnic groups, there was a need for 
      dietary information that considers traditional foods and cultural beliefs, and is 
      available in their native language. Cancer survivors valued ongoing dietary 
      follow-up and support post-treatment, and suggested a variety of face-to-face and 
      online delivery modes. Those residing in rural and remote areas reported barriers to 
      accessing dietary information post-treatment including time, cost, and availability 
      of local services. CONCLUSIONS: There is scope to improve dietary information 
      provision after cancer treatment in Australia. SO WHAT?: Dietary guidance 
      post-treatment should consider individual needs, cultural background, and 
      opportunity for ongoing follow-up and support.

TI  - Changes in methadone take-home dosing before and after COVID-19.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a federal exemption allowed 
      stable and less stable patients greater take-home doses of methadone. We assessed 
      the adoption of increased take-home medication during COVID-19 and whether increased 
      take-home doses is associated with clients' characteristics. METHODOLOGY: We 
      completed a pre-post study of adults receiving methadone for OUD from an OTP in 
      Spokane, Washington. Our outcome was the change in the number of take-home methadone 
      doses three months before and three months after the March 2020 take-home medication 
      exemption. Clients' characteristics included age, gender, ethnicity, education 
      level, homelessness, spatial access to the clinic, and methamphetamine use. RESULTS: 
      The study included 194 clients in treatment for a median of three years. All study 
      participants experienced an average increase in take-home medication of 41.4 in the 
      three-month period after the COVID-19 exemption. In the final adjusted models, 
      clients who reported using methamphetamine in the last 30 days experienced a 
      significantly larger increase in take-home dosage (55.6 days) compare to clients who 
      did not use methamphetamine (p ≤0.001). Most of the clients who reported using 
      methamphetamine were also likely to be homeless. All other variables were not 
      associated with a change in take-home doses. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that 
      the Spokane OTP quickly expanded take-home medication dosing in response to the 
      COVID-19 exemption and broadly expanded take-home dosing among established clients. 
      Clients with concurrent methamphetamine use were allowed fewer take-home doses prior 
      to COVID-19, but after the exemption the clinic provided them the same number of 
      take-home doses as clients who had not used methamphetamine.

TI  - Implementation and evaluation of a university&#x2013;hospital partnership program 
      for Type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 78-84
LID - 10.1071/AH21173 [doi]
AB  - Objective The aims of this study were to determine whether a university-hospital 
      partnership program for Type 2 diabetes (T2D) would: be well attended; reduce the 
      number of patients on the diabetes out-patient waiting list who have been waiting 
      longer than the recommended; increase discharge from the hospital clinic; increase 
      university health clinic (UHC) occasions of service; be sustainable; and be 
      acceptable to participants. Method A prospective observational study was conducted 
      between 2016 and 2019. Participants with T2D were referred to a UHC, initially from 
      a hospital diabetes wait list. The final program consisted of 10 weeks: before and 
      after individual assessments, as well as 8 weeks of exercise and education 
      facilitated by health professionals and students. Participant demographic 
      characteristics and data on attendance, discharge and follow-up requirements, the 
      percentage of patients waiting longer than the recommended for a new hospital 
      out-patient appointment, university activity and patient satisfaction were 
      collected. Results In all, 130 participants commenced the program, 80% completed at 
      least six of eight group sessions and 80% attended the final assessment. The 
      percentage of people waiting longer than recommended decreased from 63% to 16%. The 
      hospital discharged 87% and 59% of participants from the dietitian and 
      endocrinologist respectively. The UHC recorded 2056 occasions of service and 2056 
      student experiences including dietetics, exercise physiology, psychology, nursing, 
      optometry, social work and podiatry students relating to the program. Satisfaction 
      was high, as measured by the Short Assessment of Patient Satisfaction, with a mean 
      score of 23.9 from a possible score of 28.0 (n  = 93). Conclusion The partnership 
      resulted in a new model of care for patients with T2D and increased learning 
      experiences for students. What is known about the topic? Diabetes is the fastest 
      growing disease in Australia, placing unsustainable demands on the health system. 
      Access to patient-centred care and self-management education is essential to 
      optimise glycaemic control, prevent or delay complications and maintain quality of 
      life. The increasing demand of diabetes on the health system affects access to 
      timely care, with unacceptably long wait times reported, resulting in an increase in 
      morbidity and mortality and poor patient satisfaction. A potential solution is the 
      use of clinical students to contribute to service delivery. Student-assisted and 
      student-led health clinics have increased access to care across the globe for many 
      years. What does the paper add? Although group education has the potential to reduce 
      the burden on clinical service delivery, it was unclear whether a partnership 
      program using students and university and hospital resources would be acceptable to 
      people with T2D and whether this model delivered at a UHC would be sustainable and 
      of benefit to both the health service and university. The results of the evaluation 
      suggest that a university-hospital partnership program is well accepted by 
      participants, well attended, reduces the number of patients waiting for a hospital 
      appointment longer than the acceptable waiting times, increases UHC activity and 
      provides interdisciplinary student experiences. As such, this paper provides 
      evidence that this model of care offers a potential solution to increasing demands 
      for health services for diabetes and student clinical experience. What are the 
      implications for practitioners? Partnerships between UHCs and hospitals offer a 
      sustainable solution to increasing demand for diabetes services and student training 
      requirements. The description of the development, implementation and evaluation 
      processes can be used by practitioners and educators as a framework for the 
      translation of similar models of care to meet demands in other areas where demand 
      for health services exceeds capacity.

      category.

AB  - The consumption of ice cream and frozen desserts in the "better-for-you" (BFY) 
      category has grown rapidly over the past few years, even as traditional ice cream 
      sales remain stagnant. To better understand consumer preferences within the BFY 
      category, an online survey (n = 1,051) was conducted with ice cream and frozen 
      dessert consumers, followed by consumer acceptance testing of commercial BFY frozen 
      dairy desserts. Consumers of BFY frozen desserts (n = 578) completed an adaptive 
      choice-based conjoint survey and MaxDiff exercise to identify the attributes that 
      drive purchase of BFY frozen desserts. MaxDiff exercises were also used to determine 
      which attributes all frozen dessert consumers (n = 1,051) perceived to make a frozen 
      dessert BFY and which stabilizers or emulsifiers were most attractive on an ice 
      cream or frozen dessert label. Subsequently, a consumer acceptance test (n = 186) 
      was conducted using 4 commercial vanilla-flavored frozen dairy desserts made with 
      different sweetening systems (sugar, sucralose + acesulfame K, monk fruit + 
      allulose, and stevia + erythritol). Half of consumers were primed or informed with 
      the sweeteners and basic nutritional information for the frozen desserts before 
      tasting, and the other half of consumers evaluated samples blinded, where they were 
      only informed that they were tasting a vanilla-flavored frozen dessert. Sweetener 
      type and base (dairy vs. plant) were the most important attributes to BFY consumers 
      when selecting a BFY frozen dessert (n = 578). For all ice cream and BFY dessert 
      consumers (n = 1,051), sweetener-related claims (naturally sweetened, reduced sugar, 
      no added sugar), along with "all natural" and a short ingredient list, were the top 
      attributes that contributed to perception of a "healthier" frozen dessert. When BFY 
      frozen desserts were tasted by consumers, purchase intent decreased after tasting, 
      suggesting that frozen desserts made with natural non-nutritive sweeteners did not 
      meet consumer expectations. Flavor of BFY frozen desserts remains more important 
      than perceived healthiness. Consumers perceive frozen desserts, even those in the 
      BFY category, as an indulgence. Frozen dessert manufacturers should focus on 
      naturally sweetened, dairy-based desserts with minimal sweetener-related flavor 
      defects when designing products for the BFY category.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationships between physical activity, both work and 
      recreational, and urinary incontinence among women. METHODS: We assessed women aged 
      20 years and older in 2008-2018 NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination 
      Survey) cycles who answered self-reported urinary incontinence and physical activity 
      questions. Weighted, multivariate logistic regression model was used to determine 
      the association between incontinence and physical activity levels after adjusting 
      for age, body mass index, diabetes, race, parity, menopause and smoking. RESULTS: A 
      total of 30,213 women were included in analysis, of whom 23.15% had stress 
      incontinence, 23.16% had urge incontinence, and 8.42% had mixed incontinence 
      (answered "yes" to both stress and urge incontinence). Women who engaged in moderate 
      recreational activity were less likely to report stress and urge incontinence (OR 
      0.79, 95% CI 0.62-0.99 and OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48-0.90, respectively). Similarly, 
      women who engaged in moderate activity work were less likely to report stress, urge 
      and mixed incontinence (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70-0.99; OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72-0.99; and OR 
      0.66 95% CI 0.45-0.97, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Moderate physical activity and 
      greater time spent participating in moderate physical activity are associated with a 
      decreased likelihood of stress, urge and mixed incontinence in women. This 
      relationship holds for both recreational and work-related activity. We hypothesize 
      that the mechanism of this relationship is multifactorial, with moderate physical 
      activity improving pelvic floor strength and modifying neurophysiological mediators 
      (such as stress) involved in the pathogenesis of incontinence.

LID - 10.1080/02640414.2021.1976485 [doi]
AB  - To develop a statistical model of winning times for international swimming events 
      with the aim of predicting winning time distributions and the probability of winning 
      for the 2020 and 2024 Olympic Games. The data set included first and third place 
      times from all individual swimming events from the Olympics and World Championships 
      from 1990 to 2019. We compared different model formulations fitted with Bayesian 
      inference to obtain predictive distributions; comparisons were based on mean 
      percentage error in out-of-sample predictions of Olympics and World Championships 
      winning swim times from 2011 to 2019. The Bayesian time series regression model, 
      comprising auto-regressive and moving average terms and other predictors, had the 
      smallest mean prediction error of 0.57% (CI 0.46-0.74%). For context, using the 
      respective previous Olympics or World Championships winning time resulted in a mean 
      prediction error of 0.70% (CI 0.59-0.82%). The Olympics were on average 0.5% (CI 
      0.3-0.7%) faster than World Championships over the study period. The model computes 
      the posterior predictive distribution, which allows coaches and athletes to evaluate 
      the probability of winning given an individual's swim time, and the probability of 
      being faster or slower than the previous winning time or even the world record.

TI  - Associations of fitness and physical activity with specific abdominal fat depots in 
      children with overweight/obesity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between physical fitness and physical 
      activity (PA) with specific abdominal fat depots and their potential implications 
      for cardiometabolic risk and insulin resistance (IR) in children with 
      overweight/obesity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 116 children with 
      overweight/obesity (10.7 ± 1.1 year, 54% girls) participated in the study. Abdominal 
      visceral (VAT), subcutaneous (ASAT), and intermuscular abdominal adipose tissue 
      (IMAAT) were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. The cardiometabolic risk (MetS) 
      score and the insulin resistance homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) were 
      calculated. Health-related physical fitness components (treadmill test, and 20 m 
      shuttle run, handgrip, standing broad jump and 4 × 10 m tests) were evaluated, and 
      PA was measured (accelerometry). Children were categorized as fit or unfit for each 
      specific fitness test, and as active or inactive. RESULTS: Higher VAT, ASAT, and 
      IMAAT were associated with higher MetS score and HOMA-IR (all p < 0.02). A better 
      performance in all fitness tests and total and vigorous PA were strongly associated 
      with lower VAT (all p < 0.04), ASAT (all p < 0.005), and IMAAT (all p < 0.005). Fit 
      or active children had lower VAT, ASAT, and IMAAT (all p < 0.03) than their unfit or 
      inactive counterparts. CONCLUSION: These results reinforce the importance of having 
      adequate fitness and PA levels to reduce abdominal fat accumulation in children. 
      Given that VAT, ASAT, and IMAAT are associated with higher risk of developing 
      cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes, the improvement of physical fitness by 
      the promotion of PA should be goals of lifestyle interventions for improving health 
      in children with overweight/obesity.

TI  - Energy availability and macronutrient intake in elite male Gaelic football players.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1080/24733938.2022.2029551 [doi]
AB  - Evidence suggests that Gaelic football (GF) players do not meet the recommended 
      energy intake (EI) levels and therefore may be at risk of low energy availability 
      (LEA). This study examined energy availability (EA) in 20 elite male GF players. At 
      two stages during a season (2019-2020), repeated measures of EI, exercise energy 
      expenditure (EEE), EA and body composition were performed. Sixty-five percent 
      reported with LEA [<30 kcal.kg Lean Body Mass (LBM)(-1).day(-1)] at pre-season 
      (PRE), with 70% at in-season (IN). Mean daily carbohydrate intake (PRE 
      3.2 ± 0.82 g.kg; IN 3.4 ± 0.79 g.kg) was below the recommended intake (5-7 g.kg) in 
      95% at PRE and 100% at IN. All consumed the recommended daily amount of protein (PRE 
      1.85 ± 0.57 g.kg; IN 1.87 ± 0.48 g.kg) and fat (PRE 1.23 ± 0.4 g.kg; IN 
      1.02 ± 0.3 g.kg). Significant correlations (P = 0.001) were reported between EA and 
      carbohydrates (PRE r = 0.801; IN r = 0.714); protein (PRE r = 0.675; IN r = 0.769); 
      fat (PRE r = 0.805; IN r = 0.733) and energy intake (PRE r = 0.960; IN r = 0.949). 
      Twenty percent were at risk of disordered eating. This study suggests male elite GF 
      players require education and interventions surrounding nutrition, in particular EA.

TI  - Body composition and eating behavior in non-professional adolescent female dancers.
PG  - 207-214
LID - 10.23736/S0022-4707.21.11817-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dance is one of the most practiced sports in women's childhood and 
      adolescence. It is often difficult for dancers to maintain a normal body composition 
      without changing their eating habits, despite the presence of high intensity 
      training. The study aims to investigate, through nutritional habits and body 
      composition, the impact of this sports regime in the prepubertal period. METHODS: 
      Two groups of 10 adolescent dancers of classic and modern style were evaluated in 
      terms of anthropometric parameters and hydration. Lifestyle, eating habits, 
      adherence to Mediterranean diet, characteristics of menstrual cycle and risk 
      stratification of Athletes' Triad Syndrome were evaluated through questionnaires. 
      The data were reinterpreted based on the presence or absence of menarche. RESULTS: 
      The average BMI value was within the normal range (17.9±2.2 kg/m(2)) in both groups. 
      No significant differences emerged for anthropometric parameters and body 
      composition between the two groups with the exclusion of the suprailiac fold which 
      was significantly lower in G2 (classical: 0.1±0.1 mm) compared to G1 (modern: 
      11.0±6.6 mm) P<0.001. Instead, differences observed (P<0.05) was related to the 
      presence or absence of the menstrual cycle. Despite the poor adherence to the 
      Mediterranean diet, there was no evidence of risk of developing eating disorders or 
      Athletes' Triad Syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The training of classical and modern dance 
      does not seem to have any negative impact on the body composition especially in 
      pre-pubertal age. The onset of the menarche determines the major modification of the 
      body composition.

TI  - Harmonizing Ratings From Different School Environment Assessment Methods: A 
      Simplified Approach.
PG  - 92-98
LID - 10.1111/josh.13108 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study describes a method for harmonizing data collected with 
      different tools to compute a rating of compliance with national recommendations for 
      school physical activity (PA) and nutrition environments. METHODS: We reviewed 
      questionnaire items from 84 elementary schools that participated in the Childhood 
      Obesity Research Demonstration (CORD) project, which was 3 distinct childhood 
      obesity prevention projects in 7 communities in California, Massachusetts, and 
      Texas. Each project used tools specific to its programs, schools, and communities. 
      While this approach increased the feasibility of data collection, it created a 
      challenge with the need to combine data across projects. We evaluated all 
      questionnaire items and retained only those items that assessed one or more 
      recommendations and constructed several items to indicate compliance or 
      noncompliance with the respective associated recommendations. RESULTS: Ten 
      constructed items covered 11 of the 20 recommendations. Analysis indicated that the 
      scores detected variability in compliance both among communities and among school 
      within communities. CONCLUSIONS: The scores captured differences in compliance with 
      the national recommendations at multiple levels. Our method, designed for creating 
      common scores, may be useful in integrated data analysis, systematic reviews, or 
      future studies requiring harmonizing of data collected via different tools.

TI  - DHA alleviates diet-induced skeletal muscle fiber remodeling via 
      FTO/m(6)A/DDIT4/PGC1α signaling.
PG  - 39
LID - 10.1186/s12915-022-01239-w [doi]
LID - 39
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity leads to a decline in the exercise capacity of skeletal muscle, 
      thereby reducing mobility and promoting obesity-associated health risks. Dietary 
      intervention has been shown to be an important measure to regulate skeletal muscle 
      function, and previous studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of 
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 ω-3) on skeletal muscle function. At the molecular 
      level, DHA and its metabolites were shown to be extensively involved in regulating 
      epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and 
      small non-coding microRNAs. However, whether and how epigenetic modification of mRNA 
      such as N6-methyladenosine (m6A) mediates DHA regulation of skeletal muscle function 
      remains unknown. Here, we analyze the regulatory effect of DHA on skeletal muscle 
      function and explore the involvement of m(6)A mRNA modifications in mediating such 
      regulation. RESULTS: DHA supplement prevented HFD-induced decline in exercise 
      capacity and conversion of muscle fiber types from slow to fast in mice. DHA-treated 
      myoblasts display increased mitochondrial biogenesis, while slow muscle fiber 
      formation was promoted through DHA-induced expression of PGC1α. Further analysis of 
      the associated molecular mechanism revealed that DHA enhanced expression of the fat 
      mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO), leading to reduced m6A levels of DNA 
      damage-induced transcript 4 (Ddit4). Ddit4 mRNA with lower m6A marks could not be 
      recognized and bound by the cytoplasmic m6A reader YTH domain family 2 (YTHDF2), 
      thereby blocking the decay of Ddit4 mRNA. Accumulated Ddit4 mRNA levels accelerated 
      its protein translation, and the consequential increased DDIT4 protein abundance 
      promoted the expression of PGC1α, which finally elevated mitochondria biogenesis and 
      slow muscle fiber formation. CONCLUSIONS: DHA promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and 
      skeletal muscle fiber remodeling via FTO/m(6)A/DDIT4/PGC1α signaling, protecting 
      against obesity-induced decline in skeletal muscle function.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine how socio-demographic characteristics and diet quality vary 
      with consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPF) in a cross-sectional nationally 
      representative survey of Australian adults. DESIGN: Using a 24-h recall, this 
      cross-sectional analysis of dietary and socio-demographic data classified food items 
      using the NOVA system, estimated the percentage of total energy contributed by UPFs 
      and assessed diet quality using the Dietary Guideline Index (DGI-2013 total and 
      components). Linear regression models examined associations between 
      socio-demographic characteristics and diet quality with percentage of energy from 
      UPF. SETTING: Australian Health Survey 2011-2013. PARTICIPANTS: Australian adults 
      aged ≥ 19 years (n 8209). RESULTS: Consumption of UPF was higher among younger 
      adults (aged 19-30 years), adults born in Australia, those experiencing greatest 
      area-level disadvantage, lower levels of education and the second lowest household 
      income quintile. No significant association was found for sex or rurality. A higher 
      percentage of energy from UPF was inversely associated with diet quality and with 
      lower DGI scores related to the variety of nutritious foods, fruits, vegetables, 
      total cereals, meat and poultry, fish, eggs, nuts and seeds, legumes/beans, water 
      and limits on discretionary foods, saturated fat and added sugar. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      research adds to the evidence on dietary inequalities across Australia and how UPF 
      are detrimental to diet quality. The findings can be used to inform interventions to 
      reduce UPF consumption and improve diet quality.

TI  - A qualitative study of patient perspectives of diabetes and diabetic retinopathy 
      services in Vanuatu.
PG  - 289-296
LID - 10.1002/hpja.484 [doi]
AB  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: Diabetes mellitus is an increasing global health problem, 
      particularly in Vanuatu, where it poses a major health burden. There is paucity of 
      information on how patients in Vanuatu perceive diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, 
      access to services and management, health promotion and intervention services to 
      alleviate the issues. This study aimed to explore the perceptions of diabetic 
      patients in Vanuatu on these issues, to help inform the design of health promotion 
      materials and community activities to empower people to self-manage and shape 
      diabetic services that are integrated and people-centred. METHODS: Qualitative 
      Talanga and Kakala Pacific research methodologies were applied. Participants were 
      diabetic patients from both urban locations and rural villages in Vanuatu. Data were 
      collected from four (two male, two female) focus group interviews and thematically 
      analysed. RESULTS: There were 26 participants. System failures became apparent, 
      including the inability of the health care services to meet the complex needs of 
      patients with diabetes. The protective factors to reduce the risk and increasing 
      incidence of diabetes and diabetic retinopathy included comprehensive village-based 
      health promotion and community development programmes at the primary prevention 
      level. CONCLUSION: This study described patients' experiences of their diabetic care 
      and identified key barriers and facilitators of service delivery pathways. SO WHAT?: 
      Vanuatu needs to expand nationwide health promotion and education programmes on 
      nutrition and exercise, food insecurity and access through trade agreements and 
      provide well-trained nursing and medical specialists for early diagnosis and 
      adequate management of diabetes that all people can access and afford.

      Alexa: A 12-week Feasibility Trial.
PG  - 96-102
LID - 10.1007/s12603-021-1717-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility of using voice-controlled intelligent 
      personal assistants (VIPAs) to remotely deliver and monitor an 
      individually-tailored, home-based exercise program to older adults living 
      independently and alone. DESIGN: 12-week, prospective single-arm feasibility study. 
      SETTING: Community residences. PARTICIPANTS: 15 adults aged 60 to 89 years living 
      alone. INTERVENTION: All participants were prescribed home-based muscle 
      strengthening, weight-bearing impact and balance exercises, increasing from two to 
      four 10-minute sessions per day over 12 weeks. Sessions were delivered using VIPAs 
      (Amazon Alexa Echo Show 5; "Alexa") and a novel software program ("Buddy Link"). The 
      program was individualized by an exercise physiologist based on participant voice 
      responses to Alexa questions. MEASUREMENTS: Study outcomes were feasibility (rate of 
      retention, adherence, and adverse events), usability (System Usability Scale) and 
      changes to quality of life (European Quality of Life Scale), and lower-extremity 
      function (30 second sit-to-stand test). RESULTS: All 15 participants (mean age, 70.3 
      years) completed the study (retention 100%). Mean adherence to the exercise program 
      was 115% (i.e., collectively all participants were prescribed 8640 exercises but 
      completed 9944 exercises) with no adverse events reported to be related to the 
      intervention and usability scored as above average (75/100). Other outcomes did not 
      significantly change across the 12-week follow-up (all P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      feasibility study of community-dwelling older adults living alone, a home-based 
      exercise program delivered and monitored remotely by an exercise physiologist using 
      VIPAs was safe and feasible.

TI  - Combined Body Mass Index and Waist-to-Height Ratio and Its Association with 
      Lifestyle and Health Factors among Spanish Children: The PASOS Study.
LID - 10.3390/nu14020234 [doi]
LID - 234
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The World Health Organization recommended simultaneous 
      measurement of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) and suggested 
      joint use to predict disease risks. The aim of this study was to assess the 
      prevalence of BMI and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) categories among Spanish children 
      and adolescents, as well as their associations with several lifestyle factors. 
      METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 8-16-year-old children and adolescents (n = 
      3772) were included in the PASOS nationwide representative study. 
      Children/adolescents and their mothers/female caregivers answered a questionnaire on 
      lifestyle and health factors. Child/adolescent anthropometrics were measured. Four 
      combined BMI-WHtR disease risk categories were built. RESULTS: A third of 
      participants showed combined BMI-WHtR categories with high disease risk (12.3% 
      'increased risk', 9.7% 'high risk', 14.3% 'very high risk'). Participants in the 
      'very high risk' group were less likely to be females (odds ratio 0.63; 95% CI: 
      0.52-0.76) and adolescents (0.60; 95% CI: 0.49-0.72), to practice ≥60 min/day of 
      moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (0.73; 95% CI: 0.57-0.93), and to watch 
      <120 min/day of total screen time on weekdays (0.61; 95% CI: 0.49-0.76). Mothers of 
      participants in the 'very high risk' group were less likely to have a high 
      educational level, be in the overweight or normal range, have never smoked or were 
      former smokers, and watch <120 min/day of total screen time on weekends. 
      Participants in the 'increased' and 'high risk' categories had mothers with normal 
      weight and ≥60 min/day of MVPA. Participants in the 'high risk' group did not 
      achieve ≥60 min/day of MVPA and showed lower adherence to the Mediterranean diet. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to a healthy lifestyle in children and adolescents, but also 
      in their mothers/female caregivers during offspring's childhood and adolescence, is 
      associated with low BMI-WHtR disease risk.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates, in the medium and long term (12, 36, and 48 mo), 
      the effect of an intervention to promote consumption of fruit and vegetables on the 
      body weight of Brazilian primary health care users. METHODS: A follow-up with 
      participants (n = 3414) in a controlled randomized trial was performed in a primary 
      health care service. Those in the control group performed the service's usual 
      intervention (guided physical exercise 3 times/wk), and those in the intervention 
      group additionally participated for 7 mo in collective activities to promote 
      consumption of fruit and vegetables. Sociodemographic, health, and body weight data 
      were collected by face-to-face interview at baseline and after 12 mo. At 36 and 48 
      mo, weight was obtained by telephone interview and was validated. Adherence to the 
      intervention was assessed by the presence of the actions. Weight change (Δ) was 
      measured by subtracting the weight at each follow-up time from the baseline 
      measurement. RESULTS: Participants in both groups had a minor weight loss of about 
      0.1 kg over 12, 36, and 48 mo. The addition of an intervention for consumption of 
      fruit and vegetables did not enhance this effect. Higher weight loss was observed in 
      individuals with obesity classes II and III with low adherence in the intervention 
      and after 36 mo (Δ = -27.1 kg; P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Participating in the primary 
      health care service contributed to a small reduction in weight, and the intervention 
      for consumption of fruit and vegetables did not enhance this effect. However, 
      greater weight loss was observed in participants with obesity and those who adhered 
      to the intervention.

LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.42458 [doi]
LID - e2142458
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Weight-for-height z score (WHZ) is a standard indicator of children's 
      nutritional status even though it does not fully reflect body fat. OBJECTIVE: To 
      examine the combined association of WHZ and body fat with early development in the 
      East Asia and Pacific region. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Children from the 
      East Asia-Pacific Early Child Development Scales validation study, with full data 
      available regarding their nutritional status and outcomes, were included in this 
      cross-sectional analysis. In brief, a multilevel stratified random sampling was used 
      to select representative samples from each participating country in the study. WHZ 
      and body fat were independently trichotomized using established references and were 
      combined to form a 9-category exposure variable. Data collection was performed 
      between 2012 and 2014, and the analyses were conducted in June 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES 
      AND MEASURES: The binary outcome variable of not being developmentally on track 
      (hereafter referred to as poor development) was defined as a score less than the 
      25th percentile in the following domains: cognitive, language, socioemotional, motor 
      development, and total development score. Poisson regression models were used to 
      analyze the associations between the combined categories and poor development, 
      adjusted for sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: A total of 6815 children (mean [SD] 
      age, 4.02 [0.8] years; 3434 girls [50.4%]) had full data available and were included 
      in this study. Compared with children with normal weight and normal fat, those with 
      wasting and low body fat had the highest likelihood of total poor development 
      (prevalence ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.28-1.70), followed by those with normal weight 
      but low fat (prevalence ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.11-1.36). Similar associations were 
      found in language, cognitive, and socioemotional development, but not in motor 
      development. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Poor development was more commonly found in 
      children with low body fat independent of WHZ (wasted or normal weight). Early 
      public health strategies may consider using a combination of WHZ and body fat as an 
      indicator of poor development.

TI  - Effectiveness of Hospital-Based Interventions by Occupational Therapy Practitioners 
      on Reducing Readmissions: A Systematic Review With Meta-Analyses.
LID - 7601180050 [pii]
LID - 10.5014/ajot.2022.048959 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Readmission to the hospital can lead to poorer patient outcomes and 
      increased health care costs. The effect of occupational therapy interventions for 
      adult hospitalized patients on readmission rates has not been previously evaluated. 
      OBJECTIVE: To systematically examine the published literature to determine the 
      effects of occupational therapy interventions for adult hospitalized patients on 
      readmission rates. DATA SOURCES: Systematic search of five electronic databases was 
      performed from database inception until May 2020, supplemented by citation and 
      reference list searches. Study Selection and Data Collection: This review is 
      reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and was registered prospectively; methodological 
      quality of the included studies was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. 
      Meta-analyses were conducted with clinically homogeneous data; the overall body of 
      evidence was graded for quality. FINDINGS: Meta-analysis of 7 studies with 16,718 
      participants provided low-quality evidence that 1-mo readmission rates were reduced 
      when adult patients hospitalized for general medical and surgical care received 
      additional occupational therapy interventions compared with standard care. Subgroup 
      analysis of 4 studies provided moderate-quality evidence that interventions focusing 
      on the transition from hospital to the community were effective in reducing 1-mo 
      readmissions to hospitals compared with standard care. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Occupational therapy interventions can be effective in reducing readmissions among 
      some adult hospitalized patient populations, including those admitted for surgery or 
      management of acute medical conditions, with stronger evidence to support 
      transitional care interventions. What This Article Adds: Occupational therapy 
      interventions can be effective in reducing readmissions among adult hospitalized 
      patients. There is a continued need for occupational therapy practitioners to 
      understand their value and contribution to reducing avoidable readmissions to 
      hospitals.

TI  - The association between dietary behaviors and insomnia among adolescent girls in 
      Iran.

LID - 10.1016/j.sleh.2021.12.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insomnia is associated with a poor quality of life and increased risk of 
      somatic and social problems. The aim of current study was to investigate the 
      relationship between dietary behaviors and insomnia in Iranian adolescent girls. 
      METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed among 988 girls aged 12-18 years. 
      A questionnaire was used to determine dietary behaviors in nine domains. To assess 
      insomnia, a validated Iranian version of the Insomnia Severity Index was applied. 
      Multivariable logistic regression examined the association between dietary behaviors 
      and insomnia in crude and adjusted models. RESULTS: Highest adherence to regular 
      meal consumption was related to the lowest odds of insomnia (odds ratio [OR]: 0.44, 
      95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.24-0.81). Compared with individuals who consumed 
      breakfast never or once a week, those who always consumed breakfast had a lower 
      likelihood of insomnia (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.36-0.88). These associations remained 
      significant in all adjusted models. Subjects who ate spicy food every day had 4.73 
      times greater odds of insomnia than individuals who never ate spicy food (OR: 4.73, 
      95% CI: 1.09-20.56). After controlling for age, menstruation, parent death, parents' 
      divorce and parents' (mother and father) employment status, this relationship 
      remained (OR: 4.59, 95% CI: 1.05-20.10); however, the association was no longer 
      significant after controlling for the other covariates. No significant relationship 
      was found between other dietary habits and insomnia for the unadjusted or adjusted 
      models. CONCLUSION: Lowest rates of insomnia were found among participants who had 
      the lowest frequency of eating spicy foods and the highest frequency of eating 
      breakfast and eating regular meals. Further prospective studies are required to 
      confirm these findings.

TI  - Hormonal and metabolic responses of older adults to resistance training in 
      normobaric hypoxia.
LID - 10.1007/s00421-022-04897-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In young adults, the hormonal responses to resistance exercise are 
      amplified by normobaric hypoxia. Hormone concentrations and metabolism are typically 
      dysregulated with age, yet the impact of hypoxia on these responses to resistance 
      exercise are uncharacterised. Therefore, this study aimed to characterise the acute 
      and chronic hormonal and metabolic responses of older adults to resistance training 
      in normobaric hypoxia. METHODS: Adults aged 60-75 years completed 8 weeks of 
      resistance training in either normoxia (20.9% O(2); n = 10) or normobaric hypoxia 
      (14.4% O(2), n = 10) twice weekly at 70% of their predicted 1-repetition maximum. 
      Growth hormone, glucose, lactate, insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin 
      resistance (HOMA-IR), cortisol, total testosterone, adrenaline, noradrenaline and 
      dopamine were quantified at pre- and post-training, and in the 60 min following the 
      first training session (untrained state) and the last training session (trained 
      state). RESULTS: Eight weeks of training in hypoxia did not affect the resting 
      levels of the hormones or physiological factors measured. However, hypoxia 
      significantly blunted the acute growth hormone response in the 15 min following the 
      last training session at week eight (43.87% lower in the hypoxic group; p = 0.017). 
      This novel and unexpected finding requires further investigation. All other hormones 
      were unaffected acutely by hypoxia in the 60 min following the first and the last 
      training session. CONCLUSION: Chronic resistance training in normobaric hypoxia 
      supresses the growth hormone response to exercise in older adults. All other 
      hormones and metabolic markers were unaffected both acutely and chronically by 
      hypoxia.

TI  - Operationalising the 20-minute neighbourhood.
PG  - 15
LID - 10.1186/s12966-021-01243-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent rapid growth in urban areas and the desire to create liveable 
      neighbourhoods has brought about a renewed interest in planning for compact cities, 
      with concepts like the 20-minute neighbourhood (20MN) becoming more popular. A 20MN 
      broadly reflects a neighbourhood that allows residents to meet their daily 
      (non-work) needs within a short, non-motorised, trip from home. The 20MN concept 
      underpins the key planning strategy of Australia's second largest city, Melbourne, 
      however the 20MN definition has not been operationalised. This study aimed to 
      develop and operationalise a practical definition of the 20MN and apply this to two 
      Australian state capital cities: Melbourne (Victoria) and Adelaide (South 
      Australia). METHODS: Using the metropolitan boundaries for Melbourne and Adelaide, 
      data were sourced for several layers related to five domains: 1) healthy food; 2) 
      recreational resources; 3) community resources; 4) public open space; and 5) public 
      transport. The number of layers and the access measures required for each domain 
      differed. For example, the recreational resources domain only required a sport and 
      fitness centre (gym) within a 1.5-km network path distance, whereas the public open 
      space domain required a public open space within a 400-m distance along a pedestrian 
      network and 8 ha of public open space area within a 1-km radius. Locations that met 
      the access requirements for each of the five domains were defined as 20MNs. RESULTS: 
      In Melbourne 5.5% and in Adelaide 7.6% of the population were considered to reside 
      in a 20MN. Within areas classified as residential, the median number of people per 
      square kilometre with a 20MN in Melbourne was 6429 and the median number of 
      dwellings per square kilometre was 3211. In Adelaide's 20MNs, both population 
      density (3062) and dwelling density (1440) were lower than in Melbourne. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The challenge of operationalising a practical definition of the 20MN 
      has been addressed by this study and applied to two Australian cities. The approach 
      can be adapted to other contexts as a first step to assessing the presence of 
      existing 20MNs and monitoring further implementation of this concept.

      Effect of Sex Steroid Hormones on Breast Cancer Risk.
PG  - 28-37
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-21-0438 [doi]
AB  - We undertook a systematic review and appraised the evidence for an effect of 
      circulating sex steroid hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) on breast 
      cancer risk in pre- and postmenopausal women. Systematic searches identified 
      prospective studies relevant to this review. Meta-analyses estimated breast cancer 
      risk for women with the highest compared with the lowest level of sex hormones, and 
      the DRMETA Stata package was used to graphically represent the shape of these 
      associations. The ROBINS-E tool assessed risk of bias, and the GRADE system 
      appraised the strength of evidence. In premenopausal women, there was little 
      evidence that estrogens, progesterone, or SHBG were associated with breast cancer 
      risk, whereas androgens showed a positive association. In postmenopausal women, 
      higher estrogens and androgens were associated with an increase in breast cancer 
      risk, whereas higher SHBG was inversely associated with risk. The strength of the 
      evidence quality ranged from low to high for each hormone. Dose-response 
      relationships between sex steroid hormone concentrations and breast cancer risk were 
      most notable for postmenopausal women. These data support the plausibility of a role 
      for sex steroid hormones in mediating the causal relationship between physical 
      activity and the risk of breast cancer.See related reviews by Lynch et al., p. 11 
      and Swain et al., p. 16.

TI  - Altered cardiac reserve is a determinant of exercise intolerance in sickle cell 
      anaemia patients.
PG  - e13664
LID - 10.1111/eci.13664 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The underlying mechanisms of exercise intolerance in sickle cell anaemia 
      (SCA) patients are complex and not yet completely understood. While latent heart 
      failure at rest could be unmasked upon exercise, most previous studies assessed 
      cardiac function at rest. We aimed to investigate exercise cardiovascular reserve as 
      a potential contributor to exercise intolerance in adult SCA patients. METHODS: In 
      this observational prospective study, we compared prospectively 60 SCA patients 
      (median age 31 years, 60% women) to 20 matched controls. All subjects underwent 
      symptom-limited combined exercise echocardiography and oxygen uptake (VO(2) ) 
      measurements. Differences between arterial and venous oxygen content (C(a-v)O(2) ) 
      were calculated. Cardiac reserve was defined as the absolute change in cardiac index 
      (Ci) from baseline to peak exercise. RESULTS: Compared to controls, SCA patients 
      demonstrated severe exercise intolerance (median peakVO(2) , 34.3 vs. 
      19.7 ml/min/kg, respectively, p < .0001). SCA patients displayed heterogeneously 
      increased Ci from rest to peak exercise (median +5.8, range 2.6 to 10.6 L/min/m²) 
      which correlated with peakVO(2) (r = 0.71, p < .0001). In contrast, the C(a-v)O(2) 
      exercise reserve was homogenously reduced and did not correlate with peakVO(2) 
      (r = 0.18, p = .16). While haemoglobin level and C(a-v)O(2) were similar in SCA 
      subgroups, SCA patients in the lower VO(2) tertile had chronotropic incompetence and 
      left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (left atrial peak longitudinal strain was 
      reduced, and both E/e' ratio and left atrial volume index were increased) and were 
      characterized by a reduced cardiac reserve, +5.0[4.2-5.5] compared to +6.7[5.5-7.8] 
      L/min/m² for the rest of the patient cohort, p < .0001. CONCLUSIONS: Altered cardiac 
      reserve due to chronotropic incompetence and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction 
      seems to be an important determinant of exercise intolerance in adult SCA patients.

TI  - Animal source foods, rich in essential amino acids, are important for linear growth 
      and development of young children in low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - Growth faltering under 5 years of age is unacceptably high worldwide, and even more 
      children, while not stunted, fail to reach their growth potential. The time between 
      conception and 2 years of age is critical for development. The period from 6 to 23 
      months, when complementary foods are introduced, coincides with a time when growth 
      faltering and delayed neurocognitive developments are most common. Fortunately, this 
      is also the period when diet exercises its greatest influence. Growing up in an 
      adverse environment, with a deficient diet, as typically seen in low- and 
      middle-income countries (LMICs), hampers growth and development of children and 
      prevents them from realising their full developmental and economic future potential. 
      Sufficient nutrient availability and utilisation are paramount to a child's growth 
      and development trajectory, especially in the period after breastfeeding. This 
      review highlights the importance of essential amino acids (EAAs) in early life for 
      linear growth and, likely, neurocognitive development. The paper further discusses 
      signalling through mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) as one of the 
      main amino acid (AA)-sensing hubs and the master regulator of both growth and 
      neurocognitive development. Children in LMICs, despite consuming sufficient total 
      protein, do not meet their EAA requirements due to poor diet diversity and 
      low-quality dietary protein. AA deficiencies in early life can cause reductions in 
      linear growth and cognition. Ensuring AA adequacy in diets, particularly through 
      inclusion of nutrient-dense animal source foods from 6 to 23 months, is strongly 
      encouraged in LMICs in order to compensate for less than optimal growth during 
      complementary feeding.

AB  - We examined the relationship between leg extensor muscle strength (LEMS) at 
      discharge and rehospitalization within 1 year in patients with a newly implanted 
      ventricular assist device (VAD). This study included 28 patients who had received a 
      VAD at our institution between October 2013 and February 2019, all of whom had been 
      discharged for 1 year. The patients were divided into two groups according to their 
      LEMS at discharge (higher strength [group H] and lower strength [group L]), based on 
      the median value of the 55.2 kg-force (kgf)/body weight (BW) equation. Exercise 
      performance parameters (e.g., grip strength, 6-min walk distance, and peak VO(2)) 
      and laboratory data concerning nutritional status were also collected. Nine patients 
      (64.3%) in group L were rehospitalized within 1 year after discharge. The 
      rehospitalization rate was significantly higher in group L than group H (p = 0.020). 
      Compared with discharge, patients exhibited higher grip strength (56.3 vs. 
      48.6 kg/BW, respectively; p = 0.011), 6-min walk distances (588 vs. 470 m, 
      respectively; p = 0.002), and peak VO(2) (15.4 vs. 11.9 mL/min/kg, respectively; 
      p < 0.001) at 1 year after discharge. However, the LEMS (57.4 vs. 58.0 kgf/BW, 
      respectively; p = 0.798) did not increase after discharge in VAD patients who 
      avoided rehospitalization. LEMS at discharge was associated with rehospitalization 
      after VAD surgery; a high LEMS improves the likelihood of avoiding 
      rehospitalization.

TI  - Spirulina supplementation during gradual weight loss in competitive wrestlers.
PG  - 248-256
LID - 10.1017/S000711452100091X [doi]
AB  - We aimed to assess the effects of spirulina supplementation during gradual weight 
      loss on serum concentrations of follistatin (FST), myostatin (MST), insulin-like 
      growth factor 1 (IGF-1), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase 
      (ALT) and body composition in competitive wrestlers. Forty competitive wrestlers 
      (age: 22 (sem 2) years) were randomly assigned to one of two groups: gradual weight 
      loss + spirulina (SP; n 20) or gradual weight loss + placebo (PL; n 20). Subjects in 
      both groups lost weight according to a designed diet over 12 d and were required to 
      reduce baseline body mass (BM) by 4%. Subjects in the SP group received two tablets 
      of spirulina, while subjects in the PL received two tablets of placebo before each 
      meal. Concentrations of mentioned serum markers and body composition were measured 
      before and after the interventions. BM (SP = -3·1 kg and PL = -2·9 kg), body fat 
      percentage (BFP) (SP = -2·1 % and PL = -0·6 %), fat mass (FM) (SP = -2·2 kg and PL = 
      -0·9 kg) and skeletal muscle mass (SP = -1·4 kg and PL = -1·5 kg) significantly 
      decreased in both groups (P < 0·05). The changes in BFP and FM were significantly 
      greater in SP compared with the PL group (P < 0·001). Additionally, MST (SP = -0·1 
      ng/ml), AST (SP = -2·1 u/l) and ALT (SP = -2·7 u/l) concentrations significantly 
      diminished in SP group (P = 0·005), while FST (PL = -0·1 ng/ml) and IGF-1 (PL = -2·6 
      ng/ml) concentrations significantly decreased in PL group (P < 0·05). Spirulina 
      supplementation during gradual weight loss is beneficial in reducing BFP, FM, MST 
      and liver enzymes while maintaining IGF-1 and FST concentrations in competitive 
      wrestlers.

TI  - The Short-Term Effect of Prunes in Improving Bone in Men.
LID - 10.3390/nu14020276 [doi]
LID - 276
AB  - Osteoporosis is a major health concern in aging populations, where 54% of the U.S. 
      population aged 50 and older have low bone mineral density (BMD). Increases in 
      inflammation and oxidative stress play a major role in the development of 
      osteoporosis. Men are at a greater risk of mortality due to osteoporosis-related 
      fractures. Our earlier findings in rodent male and female models of osteoporosis, as 
      well as postmenopausal women strongly suggest the efficacy of prunes (dried plum) in 
      reducing inflammation and preventing/reversing bone loss. The objective of this 
      study was to examine the effects of two doses of prunes, daily, on biomarkers of 
      inflammation and bone metabolism in men with some degree of bone loss (BMD; t-score 
      between -0.1 and -2.5 SD), for three months. Thirty-five men between the ages of 55 
      and 80 years were randomized into one of three groups: 100 g prunes, 50 g prunes, or 
      control. Consumption of 100 g prunes led to a significant decrease in serum 
      osteocalcin (p < 0.001). Consumption of 50 g prunes led to significant decreases in 
      serum osteoprotegerin (OPG) (p = 0.003) and serum osteocalcin (p = 0.040), and an 
      increase in the OPG:RANKL ratio (p = 0.041). Regular consumption of either 100 g or 
      50 g prunes for three months may positively affect bone turnover.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal nutrition is associated with epigenetic and cardiometabolic 
      risk factors in offspring. Research in humans has primarily focused on assessing the 
      impact of individual nutrients. OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the collective 
      impact of maternal dietary MUFAs, PUFAs, and SFAs on epigenetic aging and 
      cardiometabolic risk markers in healthy newborn infants using a geometric framework 
      approach. METHODS: Body fatness (n = 162), aortic intima-media thickness (aIMT; 
      n = 131), heart rate variability (n = 118), and epigenetic age acceleration 
      (n = 124) were assessed in newborn infants. Maternal dietary intake was 
      cross-sectionally assessed in the immediate postpartum period via a validated 
      80-item self-administered FFQ. Generalized additive models were used to explore 
      interactive associations of nutrient intake, with results visualized as response 
      surfaces. RESULTS: After adjustment for total energy intake, maternal age, 
      gestational age, and sex there was a 3-way interactive association of MUFAs, PUFAs, 
      and SFAs (P = 0.001) with newborn epigenetic aging. This suggests that the nature of 
      each fat class association depends upon one another. Response surfaces revealed 
      MUFAs were positively associated with newborn epigenetic age acceleration only at 
      proportionately lower intakes of SFAs or PUFAs. We also demonstrate a potential 
      beneficial association of omega-3 (n-3) PUFAs with newborn epigenetic age 
      acceleration (P = 0.008). There was no significant association of fat class with 
      newborn aIMT, heart rate variability, or body fatness. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, 
      we demonstrated an association between maternal dietary fat class composition and 
      epigenetic aging in newborns. Future research should consider other characteristics 
      such as the source of maternal dietary fatty acids.

AB  - Physical activity (PA) participation was substantially reduced at the start of the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between 
      PA, mental health, and wellbeing during and following the easing of COVID-19 
      restrictions in the United Kingdom (UK) and New Zealand (NZ). In this study, 3363 
      adults completed online surveys within 2-6 weeks of initial COVID-19 restrictions 
      (April/May 2020) and once restrictions to human movement had been eased. Outcome 
      measures included the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short-Form, 
      Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-9 (mental health) and World Health 
      Organisation-5 Wellbeing Index. There were no differences in PA, mental health or 
      wellbeing between timepoints (p > 0.05). Individuals engaging in moderate or high 
      volume of PA had significantly better mental health (-1.1 and -1.7 units, 
      respectively) and wellbeing (11.4 and 18.6 units, respectively) than individuals who 
      engaged in low PA (p < 0.001). Mental health was better once COVID-19 restrictions 
      were eased (p < 0.001). NZ had better mental health and wellbeing than the UK (p < 
      0.001). Participation in moderate-to-high volumes of PA was associated with better 
      mental health and wellbeing, both during and following periods of COVID-19 
      containment, compared to participation in low volumes of PA. Where applicable, 
      during the current or future pandemic(s), moderate-to-high volumes of PA should be 
      encouraged.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Approximately 40% of late-life dementia may be prevented by addressing 
      modifiable risk factors, including physical activity and diet. Yet, it is currently 
      unknown how multiple lifestyle factors interact to influence cognition. The ACTIVate 
      Study aims to (1) explore associations between 24-hour time-use and diet 
      compositions with changes in cognition and brain function; and (2) identify duration 
      of time-use behaviours and the dietary compositions to optimise cognition and brain 
      function. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This 3-year prospective longitudinal cohort study 
      will recruit 448 adults aged 60-70 years across Adelaide and Newcastle, Australia. 
      Time-use data will be collected through wrist-worn activity monitors and the 
      Multimedia Activity Recall for Children and Adults. Dietary intake will be assessed 
      using the Australian Eating Survey food frequency questionnaire. The primary outcome 
      will be cognitive function, assessed using the Addenbrooke's Cognitive 
      Examination-III. Secondary outcomes include structural and functional brain measures 
      using MRI, cerebral arterial pulse measured with diffuse optical tomography, 
      neuroplasticity using simultaneous transcranial magnetic stimulation and 
      electroencephalography, and electrophysiological markers of cognitive control using 
      event-related potential and time frequency analyses. Compositional data analysis, 
      testing for interactions between time point and compositions, will assess 
      longitudinal associations between dependent (cognition, brain function) and 
      independent (time-use and diet compositions) variables. CONCLUSIONS: The ACTIVate 
      Study will be the first to examine associations between time-use and diet 
      compositions, cognition and brain function. Our findings will inform new avenues for 
      multidomain interventions that may more effectively account for the co-dependence 
      between activity and diet behaviours for dementia prevention. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been obtained from the University of South 
      Australia's Human Research Ethics committee (202639). Findings will be disseminated 
      through peer-reviewed manuscripts, conference presentations, targeted media releases 
      and community engagement events. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Australia New Zealand 
      Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12619001659190).

AB  - Analyzing metabolism of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) can possibly 
      serve as a cellular metabolic read-out for lifestyle factors and lifestyle 
      interventions. However, the impact of PBMC composition on PBMC metabolism is not yet 
      clear, neither is the differential impact of a longer-term lifestyle factor versus a 
      short-term lifestyle intervention. We investigated the effect of aerobic fitness 
      level and a recent exercise bout on PBMC metabolism in females. PBMCs from 31 young 
      female adults divided into a high-fit (V̇o(2peak) ≥ 47 mL/kg/min, n = 15) and 
      low-fit (V̇o(2peak) ≤ 37 mL/kg/min, n = 16) groups were isolated at baseline and 
      overnight after a single bout of exercise (60 min, 70% V̇o(2peak)). Oxygen 
      consumption rate (OCR) and glycolytic rate (GR) were measured using extracellular 
      flux (XF) assays and PBMC subsets were characterized using fluorescence-activated 
      cell sorting (FACS). Basal OCR, FCCP-induced OCR, spare respiratory capacity, 
      ATP-linked OCR, and proton leak were significantly higher in high-fit than in 
      low-fit females (all P < 0.01), whereas no significant differences in glycolytic 
      rate (GR) were found (all P > 0.05). A recent exercise bout did not significantly 
      affect GR or OCR parameters (all P > 0.05). The overall PBMC composition was similar 
      between high-fit and low-fit females. Mitochondrial PBMC function was significantly 
      higher in PBMCs from high-fit than from low-fit females, which was unrelated to PBMC 
      composition and not impacted by a recent bout of exercise. Our study reveals a link 
      between PBMC metabolism and levels of aerobic fitness, increasing the relevance of 
      PBMC metabolism as a marker to study the impact of lifestyle factors on human 
      health.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Mitochondrial metabolism was significantly higher in PBMCs

TI  - Impact of insufficient sleep on dysregulated blood glucose control under 
      standardised meal conditions.
PG  - 356-365
LID - 10.1007/s00125-021-05608-y [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Sleep, diet and exercise are fundamental to metabolic homeostasis. 
      In this secondary analysis of a repeated measures, nutritional intervention study, 
      we tested whether an individual's sleep quality, duration and timing impact 
      glycaemic response to a breakfast meal the following morning. METHODS: Healthy 
      adults' data (N = 953 [41% twins]) were analysed from the PREDICT dietary 
      intervention trial. Participants consumed isoenergetic standardised meals over 
      2 weeks in the clinic and at home. Actigraphy was used to assess sleep variables 
      (duration, efficiency, timing) and continuous glucose monitors were used to measure 
      glycaemic variation (>8000 meals). RESULTS: Sleep variables were significantly 
      associated with postprandial glycaemic control (2 h incremental AUC), at both 
      between- and within-person levels. Sleep period time interacted with meal type, with 
      a smaller effect of poor sleep on postprandial blood glucose levels when 
      high-carbohydrate (low fat/protein) (p(interaction) = 0.02) and high-fat 
      (p(interaction) = 0.03) breakfasts were consumed compared with a reference 75 g 
      OGTT. Within-person sleep period time had a similar interaction (high carbohydrate: 
      p(interaction) = 0.001, high fat: p(interaction) = 0.02). Within- and between-person 
      sleep efficiency were significantly associated with lower postprandial blood glucose 
      levels irrespective of meal type (both p < 0.03). Later sleep midpoint (time 
      deviation from midnight) was found to be significantly associated with higher 
      postprandial glucose, in both between-person and within-person comparisons 
      (p = 0.035 and p = 0.051, respectively). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Poor sleep 
      efficiency and later bedtime routines are associated with more pronounced 
      postprandial glycaemic responses to breakfast the following morning. A person's 
      deviation from their usual sleep pattern was also associated with poorer 
      postprandial glycaemic control. These findings underscore sleep as a modifiable, 
      non-pharmacological therapeutic target for the optimal regulation of human metabolic 
      health. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03479866.

TI  - Potential interactions among myricetin and dietary flavonols through the inhibition 
      of human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase in vitro.

AB  - Myricetin is a dietary flavonol and possesses multiple bioactivities, which making 
      it an excellent nutritional supplement and a new drug candidate. However, whether 
      myricetin and other homologous dietary flavonols affect the activities of 
      UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) enzymes and facilitated food-drug interactions 
      remains unclear. Our results demonstrated that myricetin displayed broad-spectrum 
      inhibition against human UGTs. Myricetin exhibited strong inhibitory effects against 
      UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A6, 1A7, 1A10 (IC(50) < 10 μM) with non-competitive inhibition type, 
      while serving as a moderate inhibitor against UGT1A9 and 2B7 (IC(50) range from 25 
      to 29 μM) with competitive and mixed inhibition type, respectively. In Silico 
      docking was carried out to explore the binding models and free energies of myricetin 
      towards inhibitory UGTs. The potential risks of food-drug interactions after 
      myricetin consumption were predicted by combining the in vitro inhibitory data and 
      physiological data. The quantitative prediction in vivo of inhibition on 
      gastrointestinal UGTs by myricetin showed that the inhibition against UGT1A1, 1A3, 
      1A6, 1A7, 1A9, 1A10 and 2B7 would likely occur with high risk. The follow-up 
      findings demonstrated that morin, kaempferol, quercetin and galangin, the four 
      homologous dietary flavonols, shared similar inhibition patterns towards UGTs. These 
      findings altogether demonstrate that myricetin and homologous dietary flavonols have 
      potent and broad-spectrum inhibitory effects against most human UGTs, thus suggest 
      that much caution should be exercised when flavonols-rich foods or supplements are 
      co-administered with UGT substrate drugs.

TI  - Submaximal isometric fatiguing exercise of the elbow flexors has no age-related 
      effect on GABA(B)-mediated inhibition.
PG  - 167-177
LID - 10.1152/japplphysiol.00288.2021 [doi]
AB  - Age-related changes in the neuromuscular system can result in differences in 
      fatigability between young and older adults. Previous research has shown that 
      single-joint isometric fatiguing exercise of small muscle results in an age-related 
      compensatory decrease in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA(B))-mediated inhibition. However, 
      this has yet to be established in a larger muscle group. In 15 young (22 ± 4 yr) and 
      15 older (65 ± 5 yr) adults, long interval cortical inhibition [LICI; 100 ms 
      Interstimulus interval (ISI)] and corticospinal silent period (SP) were measured in 
      the biceps brachii during a 5% electromyography (EMG) contraction using transcranial 
      magnetic stimulation (TMS) before, during, and after a submaximal contraction [30% 
      of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force] held intermittently to task failure. 
      Both age groups developed similar magnitude of fatigue (∼24% decline in MVC; P = 
      0.001) and ∼28% decline in LICI (P = 0.001) post fatiguing exercise. No change in SP 
      duration was observed during and immediately following fatigue (P = 0.909), but ∼6% 
      decrease was seen at recovery in both age groups (P < 0.001). Contrary to previous 
      work in a small muscle, these findings suggest no age-related differences in 
      GABA(B)-mediated inhibition following single-joint isometric fatiguing exercise of 
      the elbow flexors, indicating that GABA(B) modulation with aging may be muscle group 
      dependent. Furthermore, variations in SP duration and LICI modulation during and 
      post fatigue in both groups suggest that these measures are likely mediated by 
      divergent mechanisms.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to 
      examine GABA(B)-mediated inhibition during fatiguing exercise of large muscle group 
      in older adults and young adults. We provide novel evidence to show that when older 
      and young adults are faced with a similar magnitude of elbow flexor muscle fatigue, 
      they have a similar decline in GABA(B)-mediated inhibition. This suggests that when 
      measured in a large muscle group, older adults maintain the ability to modulate 
      GABA(B) inhibition during fatiguing exercise.

TI  - Planning implementation and scale-up of physical activity interventions for people 
      with walking difficulties: study protocol for the process evaluation of the ComeBACK 
      trial.
PG  - 40
LID - 10.1186/s13063-021-05990-3 [doi]
LID - 40
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is currently little evidence of planning for real-world 
      implementation of physical activity interventions. We are undertaking the ComeBACK 
      (Coaching and Exercise for Better Walking) study, a 3-arm hybrid Type 1 randomised 
      controlled trial evaluating a health coaching intervention and a text messaging 
      intervention. We used an implementation planning framework, the PRACTical planning 
      for Implementation and Scale-up (PRACTIS), to guide the process evaluation for the 
      trial. The aim of this paper is to describe the protocol for the process evaluation 
      of the ComeBACK trial using the framework of the PRACTIS guide. METHODS: A mixed 
      methods process evaluation protocol was developed informed by the Medical Research 
      Council (MRC) guidance on process evaluations for complex interventions and the 
      PRACTIS guide. Quantitative data, including participant questionnaires, health coach 
      and administrative logbooks, and website and text message usage data, is being 
      collected over the trial period. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups with 
      trial participants, health coaches and health service stakeholders will explore 
      expectations, factors influencing the delivery of the ComeBACK interventions and 
      potential scalability within existing health services. These data will be mapped 
      against the steps of the PRACTIS guide, with reporting at the level of the 
      individual, provider, organisational and community/systems. Quantitative and 
      qualitative data will elicit potential contextual barriers and facilitators to 
      implementation and scale-up. Quantitative data will be reported descriptively, and 
      qualitative data analysed thematically. DISCUSSION: This process evaluation 
      integrates an evaluation of prospective implementation and scale-up. It is envisaged 
      this will inform barriers and enablers to future delivery, implementation and 
      scale-up of physical activity interventions. To our knowledge, this is the first 
      paper to describe the application of PRACTIS to guide the process evaluation of 
      physical activity interventions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian and New Zealand

TI  - Exposure to O(3) and NO(2) in physically active adults: an evaluation of 
      physiological parameters and health risk assessment.
LID - 10.1007/s10653-021-01194-5 [doi]
AB  - The gaseous air pollutants ozone (O(3)) and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) have a large 
      public health relevance and trigger environmental health risk. On the other hand, 
      despite the health benefits, exercise practices might increase the susceptibility to 
      air pollutants exposure. However, there are innumerous lifestyle factors besides 
      physical activity habits that must be considered in the daily air pollution exposure 
      and are still not fully comprehended. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of 
      O(3) and NO(2) exposure on cardiorespiratory fitness, lipid accumulation product 
      (LAP), and environmental health risk during the entire daily routine of physically 
      active adults that exercise in outdoor and indoor environments. One hundred and 
      twenty healthy young men were assigned to untrained (n = 52), indoor exercise 
      (n = 36), and outdoor exercise (n = 32) groups, following their lifestyle exercise 
      habits, and O(3) and NO(2) were assessed by personal monitoring. Exercised groups 
      demonstrated higher healthy eating index (HEI) (p < 0.001), physical activity (PA) 
      (p < 0.001), metabolic equivalent of task (MET) (p < 0.001), and peak oxygen uptake 
      VO(2peak) (p < 0.001), while outdoor group had lower LAP index (p < 0.001) and 
      higher O(3) concentration (p = 0.0442). Environmental health risk demonstrated no 
      difference (p > 0.05). The higher O(3) concentration was positively correlated with 
      the risk quotient (p = 0.003) and MET (p = 0.020), and a negative correlation 
      between LAP and VO(2peak) was observed (p < 0.001). In conclusion, physically active 
      individuals might have a lower risk of developing cardiovascular and metabolic 
      diseases despite the higher O(3) concentration exposure, and the exposure during 
      exercise did not represent an additional health risk.

TI  - How have media campaigns been used to promote and discourage healthy and unhealthy

      research to reduce sugary beverage health risks.
PG  - e13425
LID - 10.1111/obr.13425 [doi]
AB  - Sugary beverage consumption is associated with many health risks. This study used a 
      proof-of-concept media campaign typology to examine U.S. beverage campaigns that 
      promoted healthy beverages and encouraged or discouraged sugary beverages. We used a 
      three-step systematic scoping review to identify, organize, analyze, and synthesize 
      evidence. Step 1 used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and 
      Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines to search four 
      electronic databases and gray literature through 2021. Step 2 categorized relevant 
      media campaigns using a media campaign typology. Step 3 examined campaign evaluation 
      outcomes. We identified 280 campaigns organized into six campaign typology 
      categories. The media landscape was dominated by corporate marketing campaigns for 
      branded sugary beverages (65.8%; n = 184) followed by public awareness (9.6%; 
      n = 27), public policy (8.2%; n = 23), social marketing (7.1%; n = 20), corporate 
      social responsibility (5.7%; n = 16), and countermarketing (3.6%; n = 10) campaigns. 
      Evaluations for 20 unique campaigns implemented over 30 years (1992-2021) across 14 
      states showed reduced sugary beverage or juice and increased water or low-fat milk 
      sales and intake. Positive short-term cognitive and mid-term retail and behavioral 
      changes were reported. There was limited evidence for long-term policy, social norm, 
      and population health outcomes. Future research is needed to use media campaigns in 
      strategic communications to reduce sugary beverage health risks for Americans.

TI  - Trimethylamine N-oxide exacerbates acetaminophen-induced liver injury by interfering 
      with macrophage-mediated liver regeneration.
PG  - 897-910
LID - 10.1002/jcp.30568 [doi]
AB  - Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver injury (AILI) is the most frequent cause of 
      acute liver failure in developed countries. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a 
      metabolite derived from the gut microbiota and is relatively high in the circulation 
      of the elderly, individuals with diabetes, and heart disease. Herein, we showed that 
      TMAO exacerbates APAP hepatotoxicity. It is possible that delayed liver repair and 
      regeneration that resulted from reduced macrophage accumulation was responsible for 
      this combined hepatotoxicity. Moreover, matrix metalloproteinase 12 (Mmp12), 
      expressed predominantly by macrophages, were reduced by TMAO in vitro and in vivo. 
      This led to the inhibition of macrophage migration and a subsequent decrease in the 
      recruitment of proresolving macrophages to the necrosis area. Furthermore, the 
      administration of recombinant Mmp12 mitigated the enhanced hepatotoxicity in mice 
      cotreated with TMAO and APAP. Overall, this study indicates that TMAO exacerbates 
      APAP-induced hepatotoxicity by hindering macrophage-mediated liver repair, which 
      might stem from the inhibition of Mmp12. These findings imply that liver damage in 
      patients with high levels of circulating TMAO may be more severe in AILI and should 
      exercise caution when treating with NAC.

TI  - Antibiotic Azithromycin inhibits brown/beige fat functionality and promotes obesity 
      in human and rodents.
PG  - 1187-1203
LID - 10.7150/thno.63067 [doi]
AB  - Obesity, a metabolic disease caused by multiple factors, has become a global health 
      problem. In addition to nutrient intake and sedentary lifestyle, environmental 
      pollutants exposure has been shown to be involved in obesity epidemics. Antibiotics, 
      a new type of environmental pollutant, have been widely used in animal husbandry, 
      aquaculture and microorganism. However, the effects of antibiotics exposure on fat 
      metabolism and metabolic diseases are largely unknown. Methods: We screened major 
      types of antibiotics to examine their effects on the differentiation capacity and 
      thermogenic functionality of brown and beige adipocytes, and found that 
      azithromycin, one major kind of macrolide antibiotics suppressed brown and beige 
      adipocyte functionality. We thus examined azithromycin accretion in adipose tissues 
      of obese patients that correlates with BMI by high performance liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and systematically explore the influences of 
      azithromycin on adiposity and metabolic performance in mice under high diet. 
      Results: Azithromycin (macrolides) inhibits the mitochondrial and thermogenic gene 
      programs of brown and beige adipocytes, thus disrupting their mitochondrial function 
      and thermogenic response. Consistently, azithromycin treatment are more prone to 
      diet-induced obesity in mice, and this was associated with impaired energy 
      expenditure. Importantly, azithromycin is more accumulated in adipose tissue of 
      obese patients and correlates with BMI and body weight. Mechanistically, we found 
      that azithromycin inhibits mitochondria respiratory complex I protein levels and 
      increases reactive oxidative species (ROS) levels, which causes damage of 
      mitochondrial function in brown and beige adipocytes. The deleterious effects of 
      azithromycin can be ameliorated by antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Conclusions: 
      Taken together, this work highlights the possible role of azithromycin in obesity 
      epidemic and presents strategies for safe applications of antibiotics in the future.

TI  - An anti-inflammatory diet intervention for knee osteoarthritis: a feasibility study.
PG  - 47
LID - 10.1186/s12891-022-05003-7 [doi]
LID - 47
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis has an inflammatory component that is linked to pain 
      and joint pathology, yet common non-surgical and non-pharmacological interventions 
      (e.g., exercise, calorie restricting diets) do not typically target inflammation. We 
      aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a telehealth delivered anti-inflammatory diet 
      intervention for knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: This 9-week single-arm feasibility 
      study recruited participants aged 40-85 years with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis 
      (inclusion criteria: average pain ≥4/10 or maximal pain ≥5/10 during past week). All 
      participants received a telehealth-delivered anti-inflammatory dietary education 
      intervention involving 1:1 consultations at baseline, 3- and 6-week follow-up. The 
      diet emphasised nutrient-dense wholefoods and minimally processed anti-inflammatory 
      foods and discouraged processed foods considered to be pro-inflammatory. The primary 
      outcome of feasibility was assessed via: i) eligibility, recruitment and retention 
      rates; ii) self-reported dietary adherence; iii) adverse events; and iv) treatment 
      satisfaction. Post-intervention interviews evaluated the acceptability of the 
      dietary intervention delivered via telehealth. Secondary outcomes included changes 
      in self-reported body mass, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), 
      health-related quality of life (EuroQoL-5D), analgesic use and global rating of 
      change. Worthwhile effects were determined by the minimal detectable change (MDC) 
      for all five KOOS-subscales (pain, symptoms, activities of daily living, 
      sport/recreation, quality of life) being contained within the 95% confidence 
      interval. RESULTS: Forty-eight of seventy-three (66%) individuals screened were 
      eligible and 28 enrolled over 2 months (82% female, mean age 66 ± 8 years, body mass 
      index 30.7 ± 4.8 kg.m(-2)). Six participants withdrew prior to final follow-up (21% 
      drop-out). Of those with final follow-up data, attendance at scheduled telehealth 
      consultations was 99%. Self-reported adherence to diet during the 9-week 
      intervention period: everyday = 27%, most of time = 68% and some of time = 5%. Two 
      minor adverse events were reported. Change scores contained the MDC within the 95% 
      confidence interval for all five KOOS subscales. Suggestions to improve study design 
      and limit drop-out included an initial face-to-face consultation and more 
      comprehensive habitual dietary intake data collection. CONCLUSION: This study 
      supports the feasibility of a full-scale randomised controlled trial to determine 
      the efficacy of a primarily telehealth-delivered anti-inflammatory dietary education 
      intervention in adults with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Personal Activity Intelligence e-Health Program in People with Type 2 Diabetes: A 
      Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - 18-27
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000002768 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Innovative strategies are needed to enable people with type 2 diabetes 
      (T2D) to self-manage physical activity (PA). Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) is 
      a new metric that uses the heart rate response to PA to inform the user as to 
      whether they are doing enough PA to reduce the risk of premature mortality. The PAI 
      score reflects PA over the previous 7 d with the goal to maintain a score ≥100. The 
      aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of 
      the PAI e-Health Program in people with T2D. METHODS: Thirty participants with T2D 
      who were not meeting PA guidelines were randomly assigned to 12 wk of either 1) PAI 
      e-Health Program or 2) PA attention control. The PAI e-Health Program consisted of 
      receiving a wrist-worn heart rate monitor and an app with the PAI metric, and 
      attending 4 × 2 h·wk-1 sessions of exercise and counseling. Feasibility and 
      acceptability of the program were evaluated by achievement of a PAI score ≥100 and 
      participant feedback. Efficacy was determined from changes in glycemic control, 
      cardiorespiratory fitness, exercise capacity (time-on-test), body composition, sleep 
      time, and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Program participants in the PAI 
      e-Health Program had a mean ± SD PAI score of 119.7 ± 60.6 and achieved ≥100 PAI on 
      56.4% of the days. The majority of participants (80%) intended to continue to use 
      PAI monitoring. Compared with control, the PAI group significantly improved their 
      exercise capacity (mean difference, 95% confidence interval) (63 s, 17.9-108.0 s), 
      sleep time (67.2 min, 7.2-127.1 min), total percent body fat (-1.3%, -2.6% to 
      -0.1%), and gynoid fat percent (-1.5%, -2.6 to -0.5). CONCLUSIONS: The PAI e-Health 
      Program is feasible, acceptable, and efficacious in people with T2D.

AB  - The potential negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-compromising 
      behaviors including overeating, processed food intake, and alcohol use have been 
      well documented. However, it is possible the COVID-19 pandemic has had positive 
      effects on some health-promoting behaviors like cooking and fruit and vegetable 
      intake. The current study was a preregistered secondary data analysis using data 
      from a U.S. national, crowdsourced study (n = 868) on eating behaviors during the 
      early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives of the current study were to 
      compare levels of cooking, fruit and vegetable intake, and physical activity among 
      U.S. adults during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic to pre-pandemic levels 
      in reference groups of U.S. adults, and test whether subjective stress from the 
      pandemic was associated with health-promoting behaviors by obesity status. During 
      the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, participants cooked more often and ate 
      0.23 more cups of fruits and vegetables per day, but 28.8% fewer participants met 
      federal physical activity guidelines. Greater COVID-19 stress was minimally to 
      moderately associated with greater cooking, fruit and vegetable intake, and physical 
      activity. The positive association between COVID-19 stress and fruit and vegetable 
      intake was stronger for individuals with obesity. The COVID-19 pandemic might have 
      encouraged U.S. adults, especially those at risk for complications, to engage in 
      some health-promoting behaviors while creating barriers for other behaviors.

AB  - Skeletal muscle dysfunction may contribute to the progression and severity of 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In the present study, we characterized the 
      skeletal muscle pathophysiology in an inducible transgenic mouse model (rNLS8) that 
      develops a TAR-DNA binding protein (TDP-43) proteinopathy and ALS-like 
      neuropathology and disease progression; representative of >90% of all familial and 
      sporadic ALS cases. As we previously observed elevated levels of miR-23a in skeletal 
      muscle of patients with familial and sporadic ALS, we also investigated the effect 
      of miR-23a suppression on skeletal muscle pathophysiology and disease severity in 
      rNLS8 mice. Five weeks after disease onset TDP-43 protein accumulation was observed 
      in tibialis anterior (TA), quadriceps (QUAD) and diaphragm muscle lysates and 
      associated with skeletal muscle atrophy. In the TA muscle TDP-43 was detected in 
      muscle fibres that appeared atrophied and angular in appearance and that also 
      contained β-amyloid aggregates. These fibres were also positive for neural cell 
      adhesion molecule (NCAM), but not embryonic myosin heavy chain (eMHC), indicating 
      TDP-43/ β-amyloid localization in denervated muscle fibres. There was an 
      upregulation of genes associated with myogenesis and NMJ degeneration and a decrease 
      in the MURF1 atrophy-related protein in skeletal muscle. Suppression of miR-23a 
      impaired rotarod performance and grip strength and accelerated body weight loss 
      during early stages of disease progression. This was associated with increased AchRα 
      mRNA expression and decreased protein levels of PGC-1α. The TDP-43 
      proteinopathy-induced impairment of whole body and skeletal muscle functional 
      performance is associated with muscle wasting and elevated myogenic and NMJ stress 
      markers. Suppressing miR-23a in the rNLS8 mouse model of ALS contributes to an early 
      acceleration of disease progression as measured by decline in motor function.

TI  - Acceptance- and mindfulness-based techniques for physical activity promotion in 
      breast cancer survivors: a qualitative study.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to develop and characterize the relevance and 
      potential utility of an electronically delivered acceptance- and mindfulness-based 
      approaches to physical activity promotion for insufficiently active breast cancer 
      survivors. METHODS: The acceptance- and mindfulness-based physical activity 
      intervention was delivered to participants electronically over the course of 
      4-8 weeks. It consisted of didactic videos, experiential exercises, and 
      workbook-type activities that targeted principles from acceptance and commitment 
      therapy (ACT). We conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with participants 
      after they completed the intervention. Three coders conducted qualitative data 
      analysis on interview transcripts to identify overarching themes and subthemes. 
      RESULTS: We recruited 30 participants. Of those, 16 engaged in an individual 
      interview. The mean age of the sample was 58.4 years (SD = 13.8). The sample was 
      relatively well educated (50.0% college graduates) and mostly overweight or obese 
      (58.8%). We identified two overarching themes from interviews. They were centered on 
      (1) internal and external barriers to physical activity adherence and (2) the 
      utility of targeting core ACT processes (acceptance and defusion, mindfulness, and 
      values clarification) for physical activity promotion. CONCLUSION: Intervention 
      content was perceived to be acceptable, relevant, and to fulfill important needs 
      related to healthy living. Findings suggest that this approach to physical activity 
      promotion can be delivered effectively online. Electronically delivered acceptance- 
      and mindfulness-based approaches hold promise for helping insufficiently active 
      breast cancer survivors increase physical activity.

AB  - In March 2020 Italy went into lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic and children changed 
      rapidly their lifestyles with possible negative effects on their health status. An 
      online survey collected data on eating habits, physical activity, 
      perception/behaviour of 1027 Italian 2-11 years children during lockdown. The 
      chi-square test was applied to test differences in proportions. Results showed a 
      tendency of eating behaviour to worsen as children age and by areas. Only 32.3% of 
      the children had high adherence to Mediterranean Diet, with better scores in 
      2-5 years children. 78.1% of the children stopped their habitual physical activity, 
      with higher percentage among 6-11 and in Northern children; only 51.8% maintained 
      some activities at home, playing mainly movement games/sports. Children spent more 
      time on devices, missed school and friends, being more bored and less creative. This 
      framework highlights the growing need for strategies to preserve children's health 
      in this and future pandemics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Food insecurity, obesity, and psychological stress are interrelated 
      constructs which are thought to be connected through increased energy intake, but 
      the underlying mechanisms for these relationships remain unclear. The current study 
      used experimental methods to investigate how financial losses may influence acute 
      stress in the context of food insecurity for both parents and offspring. This study 
      also sought to examine the effect of acute stress related to financial losses on the 
      reinforcing value of food (RRV(food)) and delay discounting (DD). METHODS: One 
      hundred and six families stratified by both offspring age (53 children aged 7-10, 53 
      adolescents aged 15-17) and household financial resources, visited our laboratory 
      for three separate appointments. Each appointment included the experimental 
      manipulation of financial gains and losses, saliva samples for cortisol assay, 
      continuous heart rate monitoring, self-rated tension, and computer-based DD and 
      RRV(food) tasks. Participants also completed surveys to report perceived life stress 
      level and food insecurity status. RESULTS: Among all participants, financial losses 
      were related to decreased heart rates and increased self-rated tension. Among 
      parents reporting food insecurity, acute financial losses resulted in an increase in 
      cortisol levels. Changes in cortisol, heart rate, and tension were not related to 
      RRV(food) or DD. CONCLUSION: Food insecure parents are sensitive to financial losses 
      and respond with an increase in cortisol. However, we found no evidence for a 
      relationship between cortisol and RRV(food) or DD. This sensitivity to financial 
      losses did not extend to children or adolescents.

TI  - The association between gastrointestinal injury, -complaints, and food intake in 60 
      km ultramarathon runners.
LID - 10.1139/apnm-2021-0711 [doi]
AB  - Purpose We aimed to assess the association between gastrointestinal (GI) injury, 
      -complaints, and food intake in 60 km ultramarathon runners. Methods Thirty-three 
      ultramarathon runners provided pre- and post-race blood samples for assessment of GI 
      injury by intestinal fatty-acid binding protein (I-FABP), and inflammatory response 
      by IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and CRP. GI complaints and nutritional intake were reported by 
      a post-race questionnaire. Results GI complaints were reported by 73% of the 
      runners, of which 20% reported one or two severe complaints. IL-6, IL8, TNF-α, and 
      CRP increased significantly from pre- to post-race (P<0.001 for all biomarkers), 
      while I-FABP did not (1375 [IQR: 1264-2073] to 1726 [IQR: 985-3287] pg/mL; P=0.330). 
      The 'GI-complaints score', as the integral of the number and severity of GI 
      complaints, did not correlate with ∆I-FABP (rs:-0.050; P=0.790) or energy intake 
      (rs:-0.211; P=0.260). However, there was a significant negative correlation between 
      energy intake and ∆I-FABP (rs:-0.388; P=0.031). Conclusion GI complaints were 
      neither associated with food intake nor GI injury as assessed by plasma I-FABP 
      response. Energy intake, however, was inversely related to the I-FABP response to 
      exercise. This finding suggests that substantial energy intakes during exercise may 
      prevent exercise-induced GI injury as assessed by the I-FABP response. Novelty 
      bullets • No association between gastrointestinal complaints and gastrointestinal 
      injury (I-FABP response) or food intake was present. • There was an inverse 
      correlation between energy intake and plasma I-FABP response, suggesting that higher 
      energy intakes may prevent gastrointestinal injury as assessed by the I-FABP 
      response.

      graded exercise in physically active healthy people.

AB  - Athletes are advised to receive the COVID-19 vaccination to protect themselves from 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection during major competitions. Despite this, many athletes are 
      reluctant to get the COVID-19 vaccine due to concerns that symptoms of vaccinosis 
      may impair athletic performance. This study aimed to determine the effects of 
      COVID-19 vaccination on the physiological responses to graded exercise. Healthy 
      physically active participants completed a 20-min bout of graded cycling exercise at 
      intensities corresponding to 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80% of the predetermined V̇O(2max) 
      before and ∼21 days after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (2-dose Pfizer mRNA or 
      1-dose Johnson & Johnson). Vaccination had no effect on a large number of 
      physiological responses to exercise measured in blood (e.g., lactate, epinephrine, 
      and cortisol) and by respiratory gas exchange (e.g., oxygen uptake, CO(2) 
      production, ventilation, respiratory exchange ratio, predicted V̇O(2max), and 
      ventilatory threshold) (P > 0.05). We did, however, find significant elevations in 
      heart rate (∼5 beats/min) and norepinephrine (P = 0.006 and 0.04, respectively) in 
      response to vigorous (i.e., 70%-80% V̇O(2max)) intensity exercise after vaccination, 
      particularly in those who received the two-shot Pfizer mRNA vaccine regimen. These 
      findings held true when compared with demographically matched controls who completed 
      identical bouts of exercise several weeks apart without receiving a vaccine; delta 
      values for heart rate (P = 0.03) and norepinephrine (P = 0.01) were elevated in the 
      second trial for those who received the Pfizer mRNA vaccine compared with the 
      controls at the 70% and 80% V̇O(2max) stages, respectively. Recent COVID-19 
      vaccination has minimal effects on the physiological responses to graded exercise in 
      physically active healthy people. The small elevations in cardiovascular and 
      neuroendocrine responses to exercise after the Pfizer mRNA vaccine regimen could 
      have implications for athletes at the elite level and warrants investigation.NEW & 
      NOTEWORTHY Recent COVID-19 vaccination does not affect a large number of 
      physiological responses to graded exercise, indicating that vaccination is unlikely 
      to impair exercise capacity in normal healthy people. Heart rate and norepinephrine 
      levels were elevated in response to exercise after the two-dose Pfizer mRNA 
      vaccination compared to controls. Small elevations in cardiovascular and 
      neuroendocrine responses to exercise after recent COVID-19 vaccination could have 
      implications for exercise performance in elite athletes and warrants investigation.

PG  - 258-264
LID - 10.23736/S0022-4707.21.12049-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Providing accommodating resistance with the use of chains (CRT) is a 
      programming technique that may enhance muscle size, strength, and power. However, 
      there is a paucity of studies comparing the responses to CRT and traditional 
      resistance training (TRT) approaches. This study aimed to examine the effects of 8 
      weeks of CRT and TRT on muscular adaptations in young recreationally-trained men. 
      METHODS: Thirty men (26±4 y) volunteered to participate in the present study and 
      were randomly assigned to either CRT (N.=10), TRT (N.=10), or a non-exercise control 
      group (CG, N.=10). A resistance-training program (3-4 sets, ~8-12 repetitions at 
      65-80% of 1RM) was performed three times a week for 8 weeks. Percentage body fat, 
      arm and thigh circumferences, 1RM and endurance (number of repetitions to failure 
      60% of 1RM) strength tests in the back squat and bench press exercises, and vertical 
      jump power were assessed before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Following the 
      intervention, both training groups demonstrated improvements in strength compared to 
      CG, where greater gains were observed for CRT (e.g., bench press 1RM: CRT=28%; 
      TRT=19% / back squat endurance: CRT=8%; TRT=2%). CONCLUSIONS: The use of chains 
      during resistance training may promote greater gains in strength in young men.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of exercise during pregnancy 
      in sedentary women with obesity on longitudinal changes in long-chain acylcarnitine 
      (LC-AC) concentrations. We hypothesized that exercise training would significantly 
      decrease circulating LC-ACs throughout gestation compared with a nonexercise control 
      group. Pregnant women with obesity considered otherwise healthy [n = 80, means ± SD; 
      body mass index (BMI): 36.9 ± 5.7 kg/m(2)] were randomized into an exercise (n = 40, 
      aerobic/resistance 3 times/wk, ∼13th gestation week until birth) or a nonexercise 
      control (n = 40) group. At gestation week 12.2 ± 0.5 and 36.0 ± 0.4, a submaximal 
      exercise test was conducted, and indirect calorimetry was used to measure relative 
      resting energy expenditure (REE), as well as respiratory exchange ratio (RER) at 
      rest. Fasting blood samples were collected and analyzed for LC-AC concentrations. 
      Fitness improved with prenatal exercise training; however, exercise training did not 
      affect circulating LC-AC. When groups were collapsed, LC-ACs decreased during 
      gestation (combined groups, P < 0.001), whereas REE (kcal/kg/day, P = 0.008) 
      increased. However, average REE relative to fat-free mass (FFM) (kcal/kg FFM/day) 
      and RER did not change. There was an inverse relationship between the change in RER 
      and all LC-ACs (except C18:2) throughout gestation (C14: r = -0.26, P = 0.04; C16: r 
      = -0.27, P = 0.03; C18:1: r = -0.28, P = 0.02). In summary, a moderate-intensity 
      exercise intervention during pregnancy in women with obesity did not alter LC-ACs 
      concentrations versus control, indicating that the balance between long-chain fatty 
      acid availability and oxidation neither improved nor worsened with an exercise 
      intervention.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This research showed that a moderate-intensity 
      prenatal exercise program, consisting of aerobic and resistance training, did not 
      negatively impact normal alterations in substrate supply and demand for the mother 
      and the offspring throughout gestation. Findings provide support for metabolic 
      safety of exercise during pregnancy.

TI  - High-Intensity Interval Training in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Two-Center, 
      Three-Armed Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000002849 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Exercise training is recommended to improve cardiometabolic health and 
      fertility in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), yet there are few 
      randomized controlled trials on the effects of different exercise protocols on 
      clinical reproductive outcomes. Our aim was to determine the effect of 
      high-intensity interval training (HIT) on menstrual frequency, as a proxy of 
      reproductive function, in women with PCOS. METHODS: The IMPROV-IT study was a 
      two-centre randomized controlled trial undertaken in Norway and Australia. Women 
      with PCOS were eligible for inclusion. After stratification for body mass index < or 
      ≥ 27 kg/m2 and study centre, participants were randomly allocated (1:1:1) to 
      high-volume HIT (HV-HIT), low-volume HIT (LV-HIT), or a control group. Measurements 
      were assessed at baseline, after the 16-week exercise intervention and at 12-months 
      follow-up. The primary outcome was menstrual frequency after 12 months. Secondary 
      outcomes included markers of cardiometabolic and reproductive health, quality of 
      life, and adherence to and enjoyment of HIT. RESULTS: We randomly allocated 64 
      participants to HV-HIT (n = 20), LV-HIT (n = 21), or the control group (n = 23). 
      There were no differences in menstrual frequency at 12 months between LV-HIT and 
      control (frequency-ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.73-1.42), HV-HIT and control 
      (frequency-ratio 0.93, 95% CI 0.67-1.29) or LV-HIT and HV-HIT (frequency-ratio 1.09, 
      95% CI 0.77-1.56). Menstrual frequency increased in all groups from baseline to 12 
      months. More participants became pregnant in the LV-HIT group (n = 5) than in the 
      control group (n = 0, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: A semi-supervised HIT intervention did 
      not increase menstrual frequency in women with PCOS.Clinical trial registration 
      number:ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02419482).

TI  - The association of Schistosoma and geohelminth infections with β-cell function and 
      insulin resistance among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected adults: A cross-sectional 
      study in Tanzania.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Data on the role of helminths on diabetes in Africa are limited. We 
      investigated whether Schistosoma and geohelminth infections are associated with 
      β-cell function and insulin resistance among adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional 
      study was conducted among adults during 2016-2017. Demography, Schistosoma and 
      geohelminth infections, HIV and insulin data were collected. Insulin during an oral 
      glucose tolerance test (fasting, 30, and 120-min), overall insulin secretion index, 
      insulinogenic index, HOMA-β, and HOMA-IR were main outcome measures for β-cell 
      function and insulin resistance, respectively. Generalized estimating equations and 
      generalized linear models assessed the association of Schistosoma and geohelminth 
      infections with outcome measures separately by HIV status. Outcomes were presented 
      as marginal means with 95% CI. RESULTS: Data were obtained for 1718 participants. 
      Schistosoma infection was associated with higher 30-min insulin (24.2 mU/L, 95% CI: 
      6.9, 41.6) and overall insulin secretion index (13.3 pmol/L/mmol/L; 3.7, 22.9) among 
      HIV-uninfected participants but with lower fasting insulin (-0.9 mU/L; -1.6, -0.2), 
      120-min insulin (-12.0 mU/L; -18.9, -5.1), and HOMA-IR (-0.3 mmol/L; -0.6, -0.05) 
      among HIV-infected participants not yet on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Among 
      HIV-infected participants not on ART, geohelminth infection was associated with 
      lower fasting insulin (-0.9 mU/L; -1.6, -0.2), 120-min insulin (-9.1 mU/L; -17.3, 
      -1.0), HOMA-β (-8.9 mU/L)/(mmol/L; -15.3, -2.6) and overall insulin release index 
      (-5.1 pmol/L/mmol/L; -10.3, 0.02), although this was marginally significant. There 
      was no association among those on ART. CONCLUSIONS: Schistosoma infection was 
      associated with higher β-cell function among HIV-uninfected participants whereas 
      Schistosoma and geohelminth infections were associated with reduced β-cell function 
      among HIV-infected participants not on ART.

TI  - How are combinations of physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep related to 
      cognitive function in older adults? A systematic review.

AB  - The relationships between cognitive function and each of physical activity, sleep 
      and sedentary behaviour in older adults are well documented. However, these three 
      "time use" behaviours are co-dependent parts of the 24-hour day (spending time in 
      one leaves less time for the others), and their best balance for cognitive function 
      in older adults is still largely unknown. This systematic review summarises the 
      existing evidence on the associations between combinations of two or more time-use 
      behaviours and cognitive function in older adults. Embase, Pubmed, PsycInfo, Medline 
      and Emcare databases were searched in March 2020 and updated in May 2021, returning 
      a total of 25,289 papers for screening. A total of 23 studies were included in the 
      synthesis, spanning >23,000 participants (mean age 71 years). Findings support 
      previous evidence that spending more time in physical activity and limiting 
      sedentary behaviour is broadly associated with better cognitive outcomes in older 
      adults. Higher proportions of moderate-vigorous physical activity in the day were 
      most frequently associated with better cognitive function. Some evidence suggests 
      that certain types of sedentary behaviour may be positively associated with 
      cognitive function, such as reading or computer use. Sleep duration appears to share 
      an inverted U-shaped relationship with cognition, as too much or too little sleep is 
      negatively associated with cognitive function. This review highlights considerable 
      heterogeneity in methodological and statistical approaches, and encourages a more 
      standardised, transparent approach to capturing important daily behaviours in older 
      adults. Investigating all three time-use behaviours together against cognitive 
      function using suitable statistical methodology is strongly recommended to further 
      our understanding of optimal 24-hour time use for brain function in aging.

TI  - Diets Containing Egg or Whey Protein and Inulin Fiber Improve Energy Balance and 
      Modulate Gut Microbiota in Exercising Obese Rats.
PG  - e2100653
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.202100653 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: Dietary protein, prebiotic fiber, and exercise individually have been shown 
      to aid in weight loss; however less is known of their combined effects on energy 
      balance. The effects of diets high in protein and fiber, with exercise, on energy 
      balance, hormones, and gut microbiota, were determined. METHODS AND RESULTS: Obese 
      male rats were fed high-fat diets with high protein and fiber contents from egg 
      protein and cellulose, egg protein and inulin, whey protein and cellulose, or whey 
      protein and inulin, together with treadmill exercise. We found that inulin enriched 
      diets decreased energy intake and respiratory quotient (RQ), increased energy 
      expenditure (EE), and upregulated transcripts for cholecystokinin (CCK), peptide YY, 
      and proglucagon in distal gut. Notably, CCK1-receptor blockade attenuated the 
      hypophagic effects of diets and in particular whey-inulin diet, and β-adrenergic 
      blockade reduced EE across all diets. Egg-cellulose, egg-inulin, and whey-inulin 
      diets decreased weight gain, adiposity, and hepatic lipidosis; decreased lipogenic 
      transcripts, improved glycemic control, and upregulated hepatic glucose metabolism 
      transcripts; and decreased plasma insulin and leptin. Importantly, diet was linked 
      to altered gut microbial composition and plasma metabolomics, and a subset of 
      predicted metagenome pathways and plasma metabolites significantly correlated, with 
      plasma butyric acid the most strongly associated to metagenome function. CONCLUSION: 
      Combination of dietary egg or whey protein with inulin and exercise improved energy 
      balance, glucose metabolism, upregulated anorectic hormones, and selectively 
      modulated gut microbiota and plasma metabolites.

AB  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is associated with significant morbidity and 
      mortality. PAH is characterized by pulmonary artery remodeling, elevated right 
      ventricular pressure (RVP) and, ultimately, cardiac failure. Pulmonary endothelial 
      cells can sense danger or damage caused by mechanical injury or pathogens through 
      alarmin cytokines. These cytokines can signal proliferation to restore barrier 
      integrity or aberrant hyperproliferation and remodeling. We hypothesized that 
      IL-33 signals pulmonary artery endothelial cells to proliferate under hypertensive 
      conditions during the remodeling response and rise in RVP. To test this hypothesis, 
      pulmonary hypertension (PH) was induced in C57Bl/6J, IL-33 receptor gene deleted 
      (ST2(-/-) ) and MYD88 gene deleted (MYD88(-/-) ) mice by exposure to 10% O(2) and 
      SU5416 injections (SUHX). RVP, arterial wall thickness, endothelial cell 
      proliferation and IL-33 levels and signaling were evaluated. In response to SUHX. 
      RVP increased in C57Bl/6J mice in response to SUHX (49% male and 70% female; 
      p < 0.0001) and this SUHX response was attenuated in ST2(-/-) mice (29% male 
      p = 0.003; 30% female p = 0.001) and absent in MYD88(-/-) mice. Wall thickness was 
      increased in SUHX C57Bl/6J mice (p = 0.005), but not in ST2(-/-) or MYD88(-/-) mice. 
      Proliferating cells were detected in C57Bl/6J mice by flow cytometry (CD31(+) 
      /BrDU(+) ; p = 0.02) and immunofluorescence methods (Ki-67+). IL-33 was increased by 
      SUHX (p = 0.03) but a genotype effect was not observed (p = 0.76). We observed that 
      in hPAECs, IL-33 expression is regulated by both IL-33 and DLL4. These data suggest 
      IL-33/ST2 signaling is essential for the endothelial cell proliferative response in 
      PH.

TI  - Beverage Characteristics Perceived as Healthy Among Hispanic and African-American 
      Parents of Young Children.
LID - S2212-2672(22)00005-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jand.2022.01.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is recommended that children younger than 6 years of age avoid 
      sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs); yet, 25% of toddlers and 45% of preschool-aged 
      children consume SSBs on a given day, with the highest intakes reported among 
      Hispanic and African-American children. OBJECTIVE: To investigate characteristics 
      that predominantly low-income Hispanic and African-American parents perceive to 
      reflect a healthy beverage, and to examine the influence of these characteristics on 
      parents' perceptions of the beverages they provide to their young children. DESIGN: 
      This study consisted of two activities: a qualitative activity where parents (n = 
      102) were asked to report what characteristics they perceive to reflect a healthy 
      beverage and a quantitative activity where parents (n = 96) indicated the extent to 
      which each of the reported characteristics influence parents' perceptions of the 
      beverages they provide to their young children. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Hispanic 
      and African-American parents of young children (younger than 6 years of age) were 
      recruited from the District of Columbia metropolitan area. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Beverage characteristics and influence scores. STATISICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: 
      Characteristics were categorized by the research team based on their perceived 
      meaning. Perceived influence scores for each characteristic and category were 
      compared across Hispanic and African-American parents using nonparametric, 
      Mann-Whitney U tests, and false discovery rate adjustment was used to correct for 
      multiple testing. RESULTS: The characteristics perceived to be most influential 
      included those pertaining to perceived beverage sugar and sweetener content, being 
      natural, and containing certain nutrients. Characteristics such as being homemade, 
      made with fruit, and containing vitamins were reported to be more influential among 
      Hispanic parents compared with African-American parents. CONCLUSIONS: Findings 
      emphasize the need to address misperceptions about the healthfulness of beverages 
      among Hispanic and African-American parents. Differences in the perceived influence 
      of specific beverage characteristics across Hispanic and African-American parents 
      underscore the importance of developing culturally relevant interventions to improve 
      parents' beverage selection for their children.

TI  - Short- and Long-Term Results of Operative Iliac Artery Release in Endurance 
      Athletes.

LID - 10.1016/j.jvs.2021.12.082 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Endurance athletes may develop intermittent claudication due to 
      sport-related flow-limitations of the iliac artery (FLIA) caused by arterial 
      kinking. This study investigated short- and long-term efficacy of an operative 
      release for iliac artery kinking. METHODS: Between 1996 and 2015, all patients 
      diagnosed and operated with FLIA due to iliac artery kinking without significant 
      arterial stenosis (<15%) or excessive arterial length (vessel length to straight 
      ratio <1.25) were included. Short-term follow up consisted of cycling tests 
      including ankle-brachial index with flexed hip (ABI(flexed)) and echo-Doppler 
      examinations (peak systolic velocity, PSV) before and 6-18 months after surgery. 
      Additionally, short-term and long-term efficacy were evaluated using questionnaires. 
      RESULTS: A total of 142 endurance athletes (155 legs, 88.4% male, median age 26, 
      (22-31; interquartile range)) were available for analysis. In the short-term, 
      symptoms were reduced in 83.9% of the patients with an overall 80.3% satisfaction 
      rate. Power during a maximal cycling test improved from 420 (384-465) to 440 
      (400-485) Watt (P<.05). Symptom free workload increased from 300 (235-352) to 400 
      (332-460) Watt (P<.001). Post-exercise ABI(flexed) increased from 0.53 (0.39-0.62) 
      to 0.57 (0.47-0.64) (P<.05) and PSV with flexed hip decreased from 1.98 (1.58-2.51) 
      to 1.60 (1.20-2.15) m/s (P<.001). Postoperative imaging revealed (minor) kinking in 
      37%, mostly a-symptomatic. Long-term results were evaluated after a median 15.2 
      (10.9-19.5) years. The athletes cycled an additional 125.500 (72.00-227.500) 
      kilometres. This is approximately equal to the 131.000 (98.250-220.000) cycled 
      kilometres before the diagnosis of FLIA. On the long-term, a total of 63.9% reported 
      persistent reduction of complaints with an overall 59.1% satisfaction rate. Eight 
      patients needed a reintervention of which six were considered failures and two were 
      considered as newly developed FLIA. CONCLUSION: An operative iliac artery release 
      for sport-related functional kinking in the absence of stenosis of excessive vessel 
      length is short-term and long-term effective in most athletes.

TI  - Normative wrist-worn accelerometer values for self-paced walking and running: a walk 
      in the park.
PG  - 81-88
LID - 10.1080/02640414.2021.1976491 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to a) determine whether wrist acceleration varies by accelerometer 
      brand, wear location, and age for self-paced "slow", "normal" and "brisk" walking; 
      b) develop normative acceleration values for self-paced walking and running for 
      adults. One-hundred-and-three adults (40-79 years) completed self-paced "slow", 
      "normal" and "brisk" walks, while wearing three accelerometers (GENEActiv, Axivity, 
      ActiGraph) on each wrist. A sub-sample (n = 22) completed a self-paced run. 
      Generalized estimating equations established differences by accelerometer brand, 
      wrist, and age-group (walking only, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79 years) for self-paced 
      walking and running. Brand*wrist interactions showed ActiGraph dominant wrist values 
      were ~10% lower than GENEActiv/Axivity values for walking and running, and 
      non-dominant ActiGraph values were ~5% lower for running only (p < 0.001). 
      Acceleration during brisk walking was lower in those aged 70-79 (p < 0.05). 
      Normative acceleration values (non-dominant wrist, all brands; dominant wrist 
      GENEActiv/Axivity) for slow and normal walking were 140 mg and 210 mg. Brisk 
      walking, values were 350 mg in those aged 40-69 years, but 270 mg in those aged 
      70-79 years. Accelerations >600 mg approximated running. These values facilitate 
      user-friendly interpretation of accelerometer-determined physical activity in large 
      cohort and epidemiological datasets.

TI  - Implementation and evaluation of a nurse-allied health clinic for patients after 
      haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
PG  - 647-657
LID - 10.1007/s00520-021-06461-w [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Patients who undergo haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) often 
      have multiple health issues following hospital discharge. In many centres, 
      outpatient follow-up is solely conducted by specialist physicians. We aimed to 
      implement and describe the outcomes of a nurse-allied health multidisciplinary 
      clinic. METHODS: The clinic consisted of six disciplines-nursing, pharmacy, 
      dietetics, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and social work. All allogeneic and 
      high risk autologous HSCT patients were reviewed at 2 weeks after discharge and on 
      day 100 post HSCT, with additional reviews as needed. Occasions of service, 
      interventions, readmission data and physician satisfaction survey were collected 
      prior to and after implementation. Additionally, patient feedback and quality of 
      life survey (FACT-BMT) were collected during the first 6 months. RESULTS: From July 
      to December 2019, 57 patients were reviewed in the clinic (475 reviews, average 8.3 
      reviews per patient). Common interventions included the following: exercise programs 
      by physiotherapist (n = 111), diet prescription (n = 103), counselling by social 
      worker (n = 53), medication lists provision (n = 51), fatigue management (n = 43) 
      and nurse education (n = 22). The clinic did not reduce patients' readmission rate; 
      however, positive feedback from patients and physicians were reported. FACT-BMT 
      results demonstrated that there are unmet needs, particularly fatigue management, 
      sexual education and support, body images, back to work support and quality of life 
      improvement. From discharge to day 100, there was no significant improvement in 
      quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: This clinic provides an innovative approach to 
      patient-centred care in HSCT. It has been well received by patients who were 
      supported by multidisciplinary interventions.

TI  - Effect of an Exercise Bout Prior to the Booster Dose of an Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 
      Vaccine on Immunogenicity in Immunocompromised Patients.
LID - 10.1152/japplphysiol.00015.2022 [doi]
AB  - This randomized controlled study aimed to investigate whether a single bout of 
      exercise prior to the homologous booster dose of a SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine 
      could enhance immunogenicity in patients with spondyloarthritis. We selected 60 
      consecutive patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA). Patients assigned to the 
      intervention group performed an exercise bout comprising three exercises. Then, they 
      remained at rest for 1 h prior to vaccination. The control group remained at rest 
      before vaccination. Immunogenicity was assessed before (Pre) and one month after 
      (Post) the booster using seropositivity rates of total anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, 
      geometric mean titers of anti-S1/S2 IgG (GMT), frequency of neutralizing antibodies 
      (NAb) positivity, and NAb activity. At Pre, 16 patients from the exercise group and 
      16 patients from the control group exhibited seropositivity for IgG (59% vs. 57.1%), 
      one month after the booster dose, seropositivity occurred in 96% vs. 100% of the 
      cases. Only 10 patients from the exercise group and 12 patients from the control 
      group showed positive NAb serology at Pre (37% vs. 42.8%). One month following the 
      booster, NAb positivity was 96% vs. 93%. GMT was comparable between groups at Pre. 
      At Post, GMT increased similarly in both groups. Likewise, NAb activity was similar 
      between groups at Pre and increased similarly in both of them as a result of the 
      booster (47.5% vs. 39.9%). In conclusion, a single bout of exercise did not enhance 
      immunogenicity to a homologous booster dose of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine 
      among patients with spondyloarthritis.

LID - 10.1016/j.gaitpost.2021.10.040 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although footstrike pattern (FP) may not be a factor influencing running 
      performance, 11-75% of world-class distance runners use a non-rearfoot FP. However, 
      little attention has been paid to describe the effect of running volume on FP 
      changes when a runner is fatigued. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does the training volume 
      provide an adequate stimulus to mitigate FP changes during an exhaustive run in 
      non-rearfoot, habitual minimalist footwear runners? METHODS: The objective of this 
      study was to compare FP between non-rearfoot, habitual minimalist footwear runners 
      with a moderate training volume (MT) and a high training volume (HT) during an 
      exhaustive run on a motorized treadmill. Based on their weekly training volume 
      (distance), twenty-eight runners were arranged into two groups paired by height and 
      age. At the first visit, runners underwent a VO2max test to acquire their velocity 
      for the exhaustive run. During the second visit, biomechanical and physiological 
      analysis of the beginning and the end phase of the exhaustive run was done. RESULTS: 
      The frontal plane foot angle, the sagittal plane ankle angle at the initial contact 
      (IC), and the foot eversion ROM showed a significant interaction effect (P < 0.05). 
      Additionally, the sagittal plane footstrike angle, the frontal plane foot angle, the 
      sagittal plane ankle angle, knee flexion angle at IC and foot eversion ROM showed a 
      significant effect of fatigue (P < 0.05). Finally, the frontal plane foot angle, the 
      sagittal plane footstrike angle, the sagittal plane ankle angle, and the knee 
      flexion angle showed significant group effects (P < 0.05). SIGNIFICANCE: The 
      training volume affects the footstrike pattern of non-rearfoot, habitual minimalist 
      footwear runners when they are fatigued. The highly trained runners maintained their 
      ankle angle throughout the exhaustive running protocol, whereas the moderately 
      trained group changed the frontal and sagittal plane characteristics of their 
      footstrike pattern.

TI  - RMR Ratio as a Surrogate Marker for Low Energy Availability.
LID - 10.1007/s13668-021-00385-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Low energy availability (EA) poses severe consequences to athlete 
      performance and overall health. Suppressed resting metabolic rate (RMR) has been 
      observed during periods of low EA. Thus, it has been suggested that the ratio of RMR 
      measured via indirect calorimetry to predictive RMR using a standard predictive 
      equation (RMR ratio) may be a useful assessment of EA in athletes. This review 
      evaluated the use of RMR ratio as a surrogate marker for low EA in athletes and 
      compared methodologies for measuring RMR ratio. RECENT FINDINGS: Decreased RMR ratio 
      in recent studies often correlates with signs of low EA; however, athletes with less 
      severe cases of energy deficiency may not present with a low RMR ratio. 
      Additionally, the methodology for RMR ratio measurements lacks standardization and 
      varies in recent studies. Use of RMR ratio has promise as a complementary EA 
      measurement when used in combination with other assessment tools.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Friedreich's ataxia is an autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease 
      caused by a triplet repeat expansion in the frataxin gene (FXN), exhibiting 
      cerebellar sensory ataxia, diabetes and cardiomyopathy. Cardiac complications are 
      the major cause of early death. AIMS: To characterize the cardiac phenotype 
      associated with Friedreich's ataxia, and to assess the evolution of the associated 
      cardiopathy over 1 year. METHODS: This observational single-centre open label study 
      consisted of two groups: 20 subjects with Friedreich's ataxia and 20 healthy 
      controls studied over two visits over 1 year. All subjects had transthoracic 
      echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, cardiopulmonary exercise 
      testing, quantification of serum cardiac biomarkers and neurological assessment. 
      RESULTS: Patients with Friedreich's ataxia had left ventricular hypertrophy, with 
      significantly smaller left ventricular diastolic diameters and volumes and increased 
      wall thicknesses. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated significant 
      concentric left ventricular remodelling, according to the mass/volume ratio, and 
      focal myocardial fibrosis in 50% of patients with Friedreich's ataxia. 
      Cardiopulmonary exercise testing showed alteration of left ventricular diastolic 
      filling in patients with Friedreich's ataxia, with an elevated VE/VCO(2) slope 
      (ventilatory flow/exhaled volume of carbon dioxide). High-sensitivity troponin T 
      plasma concentrations were higher in subjects with Friedreich's ataxia. None of the 
      previous variables changed at 1 year. Neurological assessments remained stable for 
      both groups, except for the nine-hole pegboard test, which was altered over 1 year. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The multivariable characterization of the cardiac phenotype of patients 
      with Friedreich's ataxia was significantly different from controls at baseline. Over 
      1 year there were no clinically significant changes in patients with Friedreich's 
      ataxia compared with healthy controls, whereas the neurological severity score 
      increased modestly.

AB  - Maternal seeding of the microbiome in neonates promotes a long-lasting biological 
      footprint, but how it impacts disease susceptibility in early life remains unknown. 
      We hypothesized that feeding butyrate to pregnant mice influences the newborn's 
      susceptibility to biliary atresia, a severe cholangiopathy of neonates. Here, we 
      show that butyrate administration to mothers renders newborn mice resistant to 
      inflammation and injury of bile ducts and improves survival. The prevention of 
      hepatic immune cell activation and survival trait is linked to fecal signatures of 
      Bacteroidetes and Clostridia and increases glutamate/glutamine and hypoxanthine in 
      stool metabolites of newborn mice. In human neonates with biliary atresia, the fecal 
      microbiome signature of these bacteria is under-represented, with suppression of 
      glutamate/glutamine and increased hypoxanthine pathways. The direct administration 
      of butyrate or glutamine to newborn mice attenuates the disease phenotype, but only 
      glutamine renders bile duct epithelial cells resistant to cytotoxicity by natural 
      killer cells. Thus, maternal intake of butyrate influences the fecal microbial 
      population and metabolites in newborn mice and the phenotypic expression of 
      experimental biliary atresia, with glutamine promoting survival of bile duct 
      epithelial cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the rapid aging of the population in Korea, efforts to slow down 
      or prevent frailty, to support the health of older adults, should be an important 
      public health priority. This may allow them to continue living within the community 
      by keeping their functional independence for as long as possible. This study aimed 
      to evaluate the nurse-led multicomponent intervention for community-dwelling 
      pre-frail or frail elderly on physical and psychosocial outcomes. METHOD: A 
      non-equivalent control pre-, post-, and follow-up test design was used with a sample 
      of 126 prefrail or frail older adults (62 in the experimental and 64 in the control 
      group). The 12-week multicomponent intervention for the experimental group comprised 
      physical exercise, cognitive training, and nutrition and disease management 
      education. Outcome variables (Timed Up and Go Test results and measures of frailty, 
      handgrip strength, depression, social activity, and social support) were measured 
      both pre- and post-intervention, and after the 12-week follow-up period. RESULTS: 
      For each group, we assessed the significant interaction of time with frailty, 
      depression, social activity, and social support, as well as Timed Up and Go Test 
      results. In the experimental group, levels of depression decreased while levels of 
      social support and social activity increased from each measurement period to the 
      next, within the 12-month study period; those in the control group were relatively 
      stable over time. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that nurse-led multicomponent 
      intervention was effective for improving physical and psychosocial function of the 
      (pre)frail older adults living alone in Korea, suggesting that older adults can take 
      proactive roles in conducting their daily life and managing their health. A strategy 
      for disseminating widely sustainable nurse-led multicomponent interventions should 
      be developed for community-dwelling frail elderly who live alone.

AB  - Background: Few weight management interventions target young children with obesity 
      from low-income minority families. Objective: To conduct a nonrandomized, pragmatic, 
      pilot study of an adapted, evidence-based, weight management program (Kids N Fitness 
      [KNF]) customized for children ages 3-7 years (Kids N Fitness Jr. [KNF-JR]) on 
      changes in adiposity, nutrition, and physical activity behaviors. Methods: One 
      hundred eighty children (ages 3-16) with ≥85th percentile BMI and their parents 
      participated in one of two 6-week weight management interventions dependent on the 
      child's age: KNF-JR: 3-7 or regular KNF: 8-16. Comparisons were made between 
      baseline anthropometrics and health questionnaire responses, and those from weeks 6 
      to 18. Two-sample tests for equality of proportions with continuity were used to 
      measure proportions of success between KNF-JR and KNF. Results: At week 6, both 
      cohorts showed a mean decrease in BMI z-score (zBMI) of -0.02 (p = 0.3 for KNF-JR 
      [n = 43]; p = 0.02 for KNF [n = 59], with no significant group differences. Among 
      program completers, 75% of KNF-JR and 83% of KNF maintained or lowered zBMI at week 
      18 (within-group difference p < 0.01). On average across all participants, at week 
      18 vs. baseline, improvements occurred in screen time (p < 0.01 KNF-JR, p < 0.02 
      KNF), sweetened beverage intake (p < 0.01 KNF-JR, p = 0.03 KNF), physical activity 
      (p < 0.01 KNF-JR and KNF), and water (p = 0.01 KNF-JR, non-significant KNF) and 
      vegetable (p < 0.01 KNF-JR, p = 0.02 KNF) consumption. Conclusion: This pilot 
      demonstrated that an evidence-based weight management program can be adapted for all 
      age groups and results in improved BMI status. Larger, randomized controlled trials 
      are needed to verify effectiveness and sustained impact.

TI  - The Importance of Physical Activity to Augment Mood during COVID-19 Lockdown.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19031270 [doi]
LID - 1270
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on mood and 
      objective physical activity. A sample of 78 college students in Spain completed an 
      assessment of mood using the valid Profile of Mood State (POMS) questionnaire and 
      had their physical activity tracked objectively using a validated wrist-worn 
      accelerometer (Xiaomi Mi Band 2) for one week before being under COVID-19 lockdown 
      (T1) and for one week during COVID-19 lockdown (T2). Paired samples t-tests revealed 
      significantly greater (p = 0.027) POMS Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) Score T2 (mean ± 
      SD) (22.6 ± 28.0) compared to T1 (17.7 ± 22.6) (lower score represents better mood) 
      and significantly lower (p ≤ 0.001) POMS Vigor Score T2 (14.1 ± 5.0) compared to T1 
      (18.2 ± 4.5) (lower vigor score represents lower mental and physical energy levels). 
      Additionally, Total Objective Steps was significantly less (p ≤ 0.001) lT2 (15,841.9 
      ± 17,253.2 steps) compared to T1 (64,607.0 ± 50,525.2 steps). Regression analyses 
      demonstrated significant negative relationships of Total Objective Steps and POMS 
      Depression (p = 0.014, Beta = -0.277, t = -2.511), POMS Anger (p = 0.040, Beta = 
      -0.233, t = -2.091), and POMS TMD (p = 0.007, Beta = -0.302, t = -2.754) T2. The 
      regressions also revealed a significant positive relationship (p = 0.012, Beta = 
      0.283, t = 2.57) of Total Objective Steps and POMS Vigor T2. These data suggest that 
      being in a lockdown due to a pandemic may have negative physical and mental 
      health-related consequences and that engaging in physical activity may reduce these 
      deleterious mental health-related consequences during lockdowns and quarantines.

TI  - What factors relate to three profiles of perception of motor competence in young 
      children?
PG  - 215-225
LID - 10.1080/02640414.2021.1985774 [doi]
AB  - The study aims were to 1) examine profiles of perception of motor competence (PMC) 
      in relation to actual motor competence (AMC), i.e. under-estimators (UEs), realistic 
      estimators (REs) and over-estimators (OEs) and 2) investigate associations between 
      the profiles and selected socioecological factors at the individual, family and 
      environmental levels. PMC (Pictorial Scale of Perceived Movement Skill Competence) 
      and AMC (Test of Gross Motor Development-Third Edition) were administered to a 
      representative sample of children from 37 childcare centres in Finland 
      (n=441;6.2±0.6yrs;52% boys). Socioecological factors were investigated using a 
      parental questionnaire. The three profiles were formed based on age- and 
      gender-adjusted PMC and AMC z-scores. Multinomial logistic regression showed that 
      OEs (n=81; p=0.04) tended to be younger than REs (n=306; p=0.04) and UEs (n=54; 
      p=0.03). Parents of OEs reported more child health and developmental issues than 
      parents of REs (p=0.03). Parents of UEs self-reported providing more support for 
      physical activity than parents' of REs (p=0.04). REs tended to live in denser 
      population areas than UEs (n=54; p=0.03). Whilst PMC profiles revealed some 
      socioecological differences, future research needs to focus on a broader range of 
      potential correlates and untangle methodological analyses challenges to deepen the 
      knowledge about PMC development in children.

TI  - Effects of 16 weeks of pyramidal and polarized training intensity distributions in 
      well-trained endurance runners.
PG  - 498-511
LID - 10.1111/sms.14101 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of four different training 
      periodizations, based on two different training intensity distributions during a 
      16-week training block in well-trained endurance runners. Sixty well-trained male 
      runners were divided into four groups. Each runner completed one of the following 
      16-week training interventions: a pyramidal periodization (PYR); a polarized 
      periodization (POL); a pyramidal periodization followed by a polarized periodization 
      (PYR → POL); and a polarized periodization followed by a pyramidal periodization 
      (POL → PYR). The PYR and POL groups trained with a pyramidal or polarized 
      distribution for 16 weeks. To allow for the change in periodization for the 
      PYR → POL and POL → PYR groups, the 16-week intervention was split into two 8-week 
      phases, starting with pyramidal or polarized distribution and then switching to the 
      other. The periodization patterns were isolated manipulations of training intensity 
      distribution, while training load was kept constant. Participants were tested pre-, 
      mid- and post-intervention for body mass, velocity at 2 and 4 mmol·L(-1) of blood 
      lactate concentration (vBLa2, vBLa4), absolute and relative peak oxygen consumption 
      ( V˙O2peak ) and 5-km running time trial performance. There were significant 
      group × time interactions for relative V˙O2peak (p < 0.0001), vBLa2 (p < 0.0001) and 
      vBLa4 (p < 0.0001) and 5-km running time trial performance (p = 0.0001). 
      Specifically, participants in the PYR → POL group showed the largest improvement in 
      all these variables (~3.0% for relative V˙O2peak , ~1.7% for vBLa2, ~1.5% for vBLa4, 
      ~1.5% for 5-km running time trial performance). No significant interactions were 
      observed for body mass, absolute V˙O2peak , peak heart rate, lactate peak and rating 
      of perceived exertion. Each intervention effectively improved endurance surrogates 
      and performance in well-trained endurance runners. However, the change from 
      pyramidal to polarized distribution maximized performance improvements, with 
      relative V˙O2peak representing the only physiological correlate.

TI  - Two-year Outcomes of Prehabilitation Among Obese Patients With Ventral Hernias: A 
      Randomized Controlled Trial (NCT02365194).
PG  - 288-294
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000004486 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if preoperative nutritional counseling and exercise 
      (prehabilitation) improve outcomes in obese patients seeking ventral hernia repair 
      (VHR)? SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Obesity and poor fitness are associated with 
      complications following VHR. It is unknown if preoperative prehabilitation improves 
      outcomes of obese patients seeking VHR. METHODS: This is the 2-year follow-up of a 
      blinded randomized controlled trial from 2015 to 2017 at a safety-net academic 
      institution. Obese patients (BMI 30-40) seeking VHR were randomized to 
      prehabilitation versus standard counseling. Elective VHR was performed once 
      preoperative requirements were met: 7% total body weight loss or 6 months of 
      counseling and no weight gain. Primary outcome was percentage of hernia-free and 
      complication-free patients at 2 years. Complications included recurrence, 
      reoperation, and mesh complications. Primary outcome was compared using chi-square. 
      We hypothesize that prehabilitation in obese patients with VHR results in more 
      hernia- and complication-free patients at 2-years. RESULTS: Of the 118 randomized 
      patients, 108 (91.5%) completed a median (range) follow-up of 27.3 (6.2-37.4) 
      months. Baseline BMI (mean±SD) was similar between groups (36.8 ± 2.6 vs 
      37.0 ± 2.6). More patients in the prehabilitation group underwent emergency surgery 
      (5 vs 1) or dropped out of the program (3 vs 1) compared to standard counseling 
      (13.6% vs 3.4%, P = 0.094). Among patients who underwent surgery, there was no 
      difference in major complications (10.2% vs 9.1%, P = 0.438). At 2-years, there was 
      no difference in percentage of hernia-free and complication-free patients (72.9% vs 
      66.1%, P = 0.424, 1.14, 0.88-1.47). CONCLUSION: There is no difference in 2-year 
      outcomes of obese patients seeking VHR who undergo prehabilitation versus standard 
      care. Prehabilitation may not be warranted in obese patients undergoing elective 
      VHR.Clinical Trial Registration: This trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov 
      (NCT02365194).

TI  - Prehabilitation in adult patients undergoing surgery: an umbrella review of 
      systematic reviews.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The certainty that prehabilitation improves postoperative outcomes is 
      not clear. The objective of this umbrella review (i.e. systematic review of 
      systematic reviews) was to synthesise and evaluate evidence for prehabilitation in 
      improving health, experience, or cost outcomes. METHODS: We performed an umbrella 
      review of prehabilitation systematic reviews. MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, Cumulative 
      Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO, Joanna Briggs Institute's 
      database, and Web of Science were searched (inception to October 20, 2020). We 
      included all systematic reviews of elective, adult patients undergoing surgery and 
      exposed to a prehabilitation intervention, where health, experience, or cost 
      outcomes were reported. Evidence certainty was assessed using Grading of 
      Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Primary syntheses of any 
      prehabilitation were stratified by surgery type. RESULTS: From 1412 titles, 55 
      systematic reviews were included. For patients with cancer undergoing surgery who 
      participate in any prehabilitation, moderate certainty evidence supports 
      improvements in functional recovery. Low to very low certainty evidence supports 
      reductions in complications (mixed, cardiovascular, and cancer surgery), non-home 
      discharge (orthopaedic surgery), and length of stay (mixed, cardiovascular, and 
      cancer surgery). There was low to very low certainty evidence that exercise 
      prehabilitation reduces the risk of complications, non-home discharge, and length of 
      stay. There was low to very low certainty evidence that nutritional prehabilitation 
      reduces risk of complications, mortality, and length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Low 
      certainty evidence suggests that prehabilitation may improve postoperative outcomes. 
      Future low risk of bias, randomised trials, synthesised using recommended standards, 
      are required to inform practice. Optimal patient selection, intervention design, and 
      intervention duration must also be determined.

TI  - Self-management processes, sedentary behavior, physical activity and dietary 
      self-management behaviors: impact on muscle outcomes in continuing care retirement 
      community residents.
PG  - 48
LID - 10.1186/s12877-021-02691-z [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the known benefits of non-sedentary behavior, physical activity, 
      and protein and caloric intake to health and muscle mass, strength, and function, 
      many older adults do not meet physical activity and dietary recommendations. A 
      better understanding of the factors associated with sedentary behavior, physical 
      activity and dietary self-management behaviors, and muscle outcomes (muscle mass, 
      strength, and function) is needed, particularly among continuing care retirement 
      community residents. The objective of this study was to examine the factors 
      associated with sedentary behavior, physical activity and dietary self-management 
      behaviors, and muscle outcomes among continuing care retirement community residents. 
      It also aimed to determine whether sedentary behavior and physical activity and 
      dietary self-management behaviors mediate the relationships between self-efficacy, 
      goal congruence, aging expectations, social support, and muscle outcomes. METHODS: A 
      sample of 105 continuing care retirement community residents (age > 70 years) 
      participated in this correlational, cross-sectional study. Questionnaires on pain, 
      self-efficacy, goal congruence, aging expectation, social support, and daily protein 
      and caloric intake were administered. Physical activity and sedentary behavior 
      (ActiGraph wGT3X-BT), muscle mass (ImpediMed SFB7), muscle strength (Jamar Smart 
      Digital Hand Dynamometer), and muscle function (Short Physical Performance Battery) 
      were measured. Multiple regression, logistic regression, and mediation analyses were 
      performed. RESULTS: Low goal congruence predicted engagement in sedentary behavior 
      and light physical activity. Higher levels of self-efficacy and social support were 
      associated with increased likelihoods of achieving greater moderate physical 
      activity and meeting daily recommendations for caloric intake, respectively. 
      Self-efficacy and goal congruence predicted muscle function and strength. Moreover, 
      sedentary behavior and achieving greater moderate physical activity were found to 
      partially but significantly mediate the relationship between self-efficacy and 
      muscle function. CONCLUSION: Future research should evaluate whether attempts to 
      reduce sedentary behavior and promote physical activity and dietary self-management 
      behaviors and muscle outcomes are more successful when modifications to the 
      self-management process factors are also targeted.

TI  - Assessing the Walkability Environments of Churches in a Rural Southeastern County of 
      the United States.
PG  - E170-E177
LID - 10.1097/PHH.0000000000001076 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Churches can serve as important health promotion partners, especially in 
      rural areas. However, little is known about the built environment surrounding 
      churches in rural areas, including how these environments may impact opportunities 
      for physical activity (PA) and may differ by neighborhood income levels. OBJECTIVE: 
      This study described walkability around churches in a rural county and examined 
      differences in church walkability between high-, medium-, and low-income 
      neighborhoods. DESIGN: As part of the Faith, Activity, and Nutrition study, trained 
      data collectors conducted a windshield survey of adjacent street segments within a 
      half-mile of churches. SETTING: Churches (N = 54) in a rural southeastern county in 
      the United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: A summary walkability score (eg, presence 
      of sidewalks, safety features, low traffic volume) was created with a possible range 
      from 0 to 7. Analysis of variance was used to assess differences in walkability of 
      churches by neighborhood income levels. RESULTS: Walkability scores ranged from 0 to 
      6 (M = 2.31, SD = 1.23). Few churches had sidewalks, shoulders or buffers, or 
      amenities nearby. In contrast, most churches had low traffic volume and no 
      environmental incivilities. While not statistically significant, churches in 
      low-income neighborhoods scored higher for walkability than churches in medium- and 
      high-income neighborhoods. CONCLUSIONS: This study used low-cost environmental 
      audits to analyze walkability in a sample of churches in a rural area and examined 
      differences by neighborhood income. While churches may improve reach of people 
      living in underserved and rural communities, a lack of environmental supports may 
      limit effective PA promotion activities. Partnerships focused on improving existing 
      areas or providing alternative PA opportunities for church and community members may 
      be needed, especially in African American communities.

TI  - The role of estrogens in osteosarcopenia: from biology to potential dual therapeutic 
      effects.
PG  - 81-87

AB  - Osteoporosis and sarcopenia are two conditions associated with aging and 
      characterized by a simultaneous decline in bone and muscle mass, respectively. These 
      conditions share common risk factors (genetic, endocrine, nutritional and lifestyle 
      factors) and biological pathways that often co-exist in a syndrome known as 
      osteosarcopenia. Among the endocrine causes, estrogens play a critical role, 
      especially in women. Estrogens have been demonstrated to exert a positive effect on 
      bone and muscle development and maintenance. For this reason, menopause is 
      characterized by a loss in bone mineral density and skeletal muscle quality and 
      quantity. To date, studies indicate a positive effect of hormonal therapy on the 
      prevention and management of osteoporosis, to the point that estrogen is prescribed 
      as a first-line treatment for osteoporosis by the major international authorities. 
      While results on sarcopenia are still disputable, such that estrogens are not 
      recommended to prevent muscle loss in postmenopausal women, increased response to 
      anabolic stimuli with estrogen therapy suggests similar beneficial effects on muscle 
      as seen with bone, particularly when combined with resistance exercise.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The association of obesity with colorectal cancer (CRC) may vary 
      depending on metabolic status. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to investigate 
      the combined impacts of obesity and metabolic status on CRC risk. METHODS: The 
      Scopus, PubMed, and web of sciences databases were systematically searched up to Jun 
      2021 to find all eligible publications examining CRC risk in individuals with 
      metabolically unhealthy normal-weight (MUHNW), metabolically healthy obesity (MHO), 
      and metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUHO) phenotypes. RESULTS: A total of 7 cohort 
      studies with a total of 759,066 participants were included in this meta-analysis. 
      Compared with healthy normal-weight people, MUHNW, MHO, and MUHO individuals 
      indicated an increased risk for CRC with a pooled odds ratio of 1.19 (95% 
      CI = 1.09-1.31) in MUHNW, 1.14 (95% CI = 1.06-1.22) in MHO, and 1.24 (95% 
      CI = 1.19-1.29) in MUHO subjects. When analyses were stratified based on gender, 
      associations remained significant for males. However, the elevated risk of CRC 
      associated with MHO and MUHO was not significant in female participants. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The individuals with metabolic abnormality, although at a normal 
      weight, have an increased risk for CRC. Moreover, obesity is associated with CRC 
      irrespective of metabolic status.

AB  - The elder population has increased, introducing the profound medical and social 
      challenge of maintaining health in aging seniors and the need for a medical approach 
      to sustaining physical and mental health. The relationship between diseases and 
      lifestyle-related factors such as diet and exercise are important. A 
      health-conscious lifestyle improves one's health condition from a medical 
      perspective, as indicated by new wellness monitoring using health devices and recent 
      research into the efficacy of functional lunches incorporating utilitarian 
      agricultural, forestry, and fishery products and foods. For a period of 3 months, 
      and solely at lunchtime, 21 participants consumed the contents of a bento (Japanese 
      box lunch), which incorporated functional (healthy) foods. A variety of factors were 
      analyzed, including: weight, weight fluctuation rate, abdominal girth, 
      triglycerides, total cholesterol value, and 8-OHdG (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine). 
      The bento comprising functional foods resulted in a reduction in both weight and 
      abdominal girth without calorie restrictions. A reduction over time was observed in 
      8-OHdG, an oxidative stress marker, as compared to values prior to initiation of the 
      study. Usage of a health device, exercise/dietary advice from a physician and 
      nutritionist, and the availability of meals incorporating functional agricultural 
      products might help prevent lifestyle disease and lead to improved health 
      management.

AB  - We investigated the effect of Curcuma longa L. extract on endurance exercise 
      capacity (EEC). EEC is the ability to exercise continuously and recover quickly, 
      even when tired. C. longa contains antioxidants that contribute beneficial effects 
      on the body. We separated groups of nonexercise (CON), exercise control (Ex-CON), 
      branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) intake, and C. longa water extract (CLW) intake 
      (Ex-CLW). EEC increased on the 28th day of BCAA and CLW intake. Both treatment 
      groups exhibited decreased lactate levels with increased levels of nonesterified 
      fatty acids and muscular glycogen compared with the Ex-CON group. Also, the Ex-CLW 
      group possessed higher intramuscular antioxidant enzyme activities (catalase, 
      superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase) than the Ex-CON group. The 
      expression of PGC-1α, NRF, and Tfam, which are factors related to mitochondrial 
      biogenesis, increased in the Ex-CLW group. Results suggest that CLW intake elevated 
      EEC by increasing intramuscular mitochondrial biogenesis through suppressing the 
      accumulation of fatigue substances and increasing fat consumption, and antioxidant 
      enzyme activity.

AB  - The purpose of our field study was to investigate the effects of running the Boston 
      Marathon on acute kidney injury (AKI) biomarkers. We hypothesized that biomarker 
      values would be elevated immediately post-marathon but would resolve in the 24-h 
      post-marathon. Secondarily, we sought to identify sex differences related to renal 
      stress. Participants were 65 runners who completed the Boston Marathon (46 ± 9 
      years, 65.4 ± 10.8 kg). Urine samples were collected at three different time points 
      (pre-marathon, post-marathon, and 24-h post-marathon). Blood samples were collected 
      post-marathon and 24-h post-marathon. Urine specific gravity (USG) and AKI 
      biomarkers were evaluated. Pre-marathon USG (1.012 ± 0.007) was significantly less 
      than post-marathon (1.018 ± 0.008) and 24-h post-marathon (1.020 ± 0.009; P < 
      0.001). Male USG (1.024 ± 0.009) was significantly greater 24-h post-marathon than 
      females (1.017 ± 0.008; P = 0.019). Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated 
      lipocalin values were significantly greater over time (P < 0.001), and there was a 
      main effect of sex with female urinary creatinine ((U)Cr) greater than males at all 
      three time points (P = 0.040). Post-marathon(U)Cr (366.24 ± 295.16 mg/dl) was 
      significantly greater than pre-marathon (206.65 ± 145.28.56 mg/dl; p < 0.001) and 
      24-h post-marathon was significantly lower than other time-points (93.90 ± 125.07 
      mg/dl; P < 0.001). Female(U)Cr values were significantly greater than males 24-h 
      post-marathon (P < 0.001). There was no difference in serum cystatin C ((S)Cys) 
      values post- or 24-h post-marathon (P = 0.178). Serum creatinine ((S)Cr) 
      significantly decreased between post-marathon and 24-h post-marathon, (P < 0.001). 
      We can infer that the characteristics unique to the Boston Marathon may have 
      attributed to prolonged elevations in AKI biomarkers. Sex differences were observed 
      during the Boston Marathon warranting further investigation.

AB  - PURPOSE: Evaluate the impact of a new multidisciplinary allied health 
      prehabilitation service in haematologic cancer patients receiving high-dose 
      chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant (AuSCT). METHODS: In a tertiary 
      cancer centre, 12 months of prospectively collected data was retrospectively 
      analysed. Patients were referred to an allied health service for individualised 
      exercise prescription, nutrition intervention and, if indicated through screening, 
      psychological intervention. Impact and operational success were investigated using 
      the RE-AIM framework: patient uptake of the service and sample representativeness 
      (reach); effectiveness in terms of changes in outcomes from initial to 
      pre-transplant assessment; adoption of the service by key stakeholders; fidelity of 
      the prescribed exercise program (implementation); and the extent to which the new 
      service had become routine practice (maintenance). RESULTS: One hundred and 
      eighty-three patients were referred to the AuSCT service over 12 months, of whom 133 
      (73%) were referred into the prehabilitation service, 128 (96%) were eligible and 
      116 (91%) participated. Patients were representative of Australian AuSCT patients. 
      Eighty-nine patients reached pre-transplant assessment by data censoring; 6-min walk 
      distance (n = 45/89, 51%) improved a mean (95% CI) of 39.9 m (18.8 to 61.0, 
      p =  < 0.005) from baseline. Fidelity of exercise prescription was moderate with 72% 
      of eligible patients receiving the intended exercise interventions. The referral 
      trend over time (maintenance) was high after the initiation period. CONCLUSION: The 
      prehabilitation service was well adopted by clinicians. Clinically relevant 
      improvements in outcomes were demonstrated. Recommendations, including development 
      of well-integrated discipline-specific assessment intervention and measurement 
      protocols, are highlighted for service improvement. Prehabilitation should be 
      routinely considered to support patients undergoing AuSCT.

TI  - Tobacco and cannabis use as moderators of the association between physical activity

AB  - Physically-active adults are more likely to consume alcohol, but this association 
      may vary if adults also use other substances (i.e., tobacco and/or cannabis), which 
      could increase substance-use related harms. This study examined whether tobacco 
      and/or cannabis use moderated the associations between physical activity, odds of 
      drinking and alcohol drinks/week. We used cross-sectional 2005-2016 National Health 
      and Nutrition Examination Survey data (United States of America). Physical activity 
      was assessed using device-based and self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical 
      activity (MVPA) and total physical activity hours/week. Individuals were categorized 
      into one of four (poly)substance use categories, no tobacco/no cannabis, tobacco, 
      cannabis, or tobacco/cannabis use. Regression models examined substance use as a 
      moderator of the association between physical activity and the odds of drinking 
      versus not drinking and alcohol drinks/week among light/moderate/heavy drinkers (≥12 
      drinks/year). Using cannabis or tobacco weakened the significant positive 
      associations between total physical activity and self-reported recreational MVPA 
      hours/week on odds of drinking (ORs = 0.978 and 0.967, respectively), such that the 
      effect was negative or null when using cannabis or tobacco, respectively. Greater 
      total physical activity and device-based MVPA hours/week was associated with 
      consuming greater drinks/week (IRRs = 1.003 and 1.035, respectively). Using tobacco 
      weakened the association between device-based MVPA and alcohol drinks/week 
      (IRR = 0.934, 95% CI: [0.888, 0.982]). Cannabis and tobacco use weakened the 
      association between physical activity and alcohol use. The positive association 
      between physical activity and alcohol use may be limited to single substance users 
      of alcohol and could reflect shared reasons for engaging in these behaviors, such as 
      stress management or social motives.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Most previous studies on food insecurity and cardiovascular disease 
      risk factors are cross-sectional. Without longitudinal data, it is unclear whether 
      food insecurity precedes poor health and how exposure timing impacts these 
      relationships. METHODS: Data from 2000 to 2001, 2005 to 2006, and 2010 to 2011 of 
      the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study were used. Food 
      insufficiency-a screener measure related to food insecurity-was assessed in 
      2000-2001 and 2005-2006 using a single item. Cardiovascular disease risk factors 
      were objectively assessed in 2010-2011. Impacts of food insufficiency patterns (food 
      sufficient, food insufficient in 2000-2001 only, food insufficient in 2005-2006 
      only, food insufficient in both 2000-2001 and 2005-2006) on cardiovascular disease 
      risk factors were estimated using inverse probability weighting of marginal 
      structural models. Covariates that change over time were adjusted for using 
      stabilized weights; baseline covariates were adjusted for in the marginal structural 
      models. Analyses were conducted in 2020-2021. RESULTS: The baseline sample included 
      2,596 participants (56% women, 47% White). In unadjusted analyses, all food 
      insufficiency patterns were associated with higher BMI, waist circumference, and 
      blood pressure than food sufficiency. After accounting for covariates, estimates 
      were attenuated but still consistent with adverse effects of food insufficiency, 
      particularly among women. CONCLUSIONS: After covariate adjustment, food 
      insufficiency was associated with several cardiovascular disease risk factors. 
      Findings from this study should be replicated in other settings and populations. If 
      verified, this evidence could provide justification for intervening in food 
      insecurity to reduce future cardiovascular disease risk.

      Healthy Young Adults in Poland.

LID - 350
AB  - The numerous consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 
      healthy young people and the lack of clarity as to the long-term disease outcomes 
      have spurred the search for risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aimed to 
      evaluate the associations of nutritional behaviors, gut microbiota, and physical 
      activity with the risk of COVID-19 in healthy young nonobese people. Data on body 
      composition, anthropometric measurements, physical activity, dietary intake, and gut 
      microbiota were obtained from 95 adults (mean age, 34.66 ± 5.76 years). A balanced 
      diet rich in vegetables and fruit, including nuts, wholegrain cereal products, and 
      legumes, covers the need for vitamins and minerals. Such a diet can be an effective 
      measure to reduce the risk of COVID-19 in nonobese healthy physically active young 
      people with normal immune function. People with balanced diet and an average daily 
      consumption of >500 g of vegetables and fruit and >10 g of nuts had an 86% lower 
      risk of COVID-19 compared with those whose diet was not balanced and who consumed 
      lower amounts of these products. It is well documented that proper nutrition, 
      physical activity, and maintenance of normal weight facilitate good health by 
      ensuring optimal immune function. The beneficial effects of these interventions 
      should be strongly emphasized during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nursing home residents are in high risk of vitamin D deficiency, which 
      negatively affects bone health. Vitamin D and calcium supplements haves shown to 
      increase bone density and reduce fracture risk. Therefore, The Danish Health 
      Authority recommends all nursing home residents a daily supplement of 20 μg vitamin 
      D and 800-1000 mg calcium. However, adherence to the recommendation and knowledge of 
      it is unknown. The aims of this study were to investigate adherence, knowledge, and 
      potential barriers to this recommendation in Denmark. METHODS: A cross-sectional 
      electronic survey was conducted in May-June 2020 among 50 randomly selected nursing 
      homes widely distributed in Denmark. Questions included degree of adherence to the 
      recommendation at each nursing home as well as respondent's knowledge and attitudes 
      towards it, and experienced barriers in relation to adherence. RESULTS: Respondents 
      from 41 nursing homes answered the questionnaire, and these were mainly nurses (63%) 
      or nursing home leaders (20%). Low adherence (≤ 40% of residents receiving both 
      supplements) was reported at 35% of nursing homes, and only 8% of the nursing homes 
      had a high adherence (> 80% of residents receiving both supplements). Most 
      respondents (88%) had knowledge of the recommendation and 62% rated importance of 
      increased implementation as high. Common explanations of low implementation were a 
      lack of prescription by the general practitioner in the central electronic database 
      (60%), resident-refusal to eat tablets (43%), chewing-swallowing difficulties (40%), 
      and a high number of tablets given to the residents daily (34%). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      recommendation of daily vitamin D and calcium supplements to Danish nursing home 
      residents is poorly implemented even though knowledge of the recommendation is 
      relatively high. Barriers relate to an ambiguity of responsibility between the 
      general practitioners and the nursing home staff, as well as the high number of 
      tablets to be consumed in total by the residents. These barriers must be targeted to 
      improve adherence in this vulnerable group of institutionalized older adults.

TI  - Physical Activity and Total Daily Energy Expenditure in Older US Adults: Constrained 
      versus Additive Models.
PG  - 98-105
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000002759 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine the shape of the relationship between physical 
      activity (PA) and total energy expenditure (TEE) and to explore the role of energy 
      balance status (negative, stable, positive) in influencing this association. 
      METHODS: Cross-sectional. Participants were 584 older adults (50-74 yr) 
      participating in the Interactive Diet and Activity Tracking in AARP study. TEE was 
      assessed by doubly labeled water and PA by accelerometer. The relationship between 
      PA and TEE was assessed visually and using nonlinear methods (restricted cubic 
      splines). Percent weight change (>3%) over a 6-month period was used as a proxy 
      measurement of energy balance status. RESULTS: TEE generally increased with 
      increasing deciles of PA averaging 2354 (SD, 351) kcal·d-1 in the bottom decile to 
      2693 (SD, 480) kcal·d-1 in the top decile. Cubic spline models showed an approximate 
      linear association between PA and TEE (linear relation, P < 0.0001; curvature, P = 
      0.920). Results were similar in subgroup analyses for individuals classified as 
      stable or positive energy balance. For those in negative energy balance, TEE was 
      generally flat with increasing deciles of PA averaging 2428 (SD, 285) kcal·d-1 in 
      the bottom decile to 2372 (SD, 560) kcal·d-1 in the top decile. CONCLUSIONS: Energy 
      balance status seems to play an important role in the relationship between PA and 
      TEE. When in a positive energy balance, the relationship between TEE and PA was 
      consistent with an additive model; however, when energy balance was negative, TEE 
      seems to be consistent with a constrained model. These findings support PA for 
      weight gain prevention by increasing TEE; however, the effect of PA on TEE during 
      periods of weight loss may be limited. An adequately powered, prospective study is 
      warranted to confirm these exploratory findings.

TI  - The Niche of n-of-1 Trials in Precision Medicine for Weight Loss and Obesity 
      Treatment: Back to the Future.
LID - 10.1007/s13668-022-00404-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The n-of-1 clinical trials are considered the epitome of 
      individualized health care. They are employed to address differences in treatment 
      response and adverse events between patients, in a comparative effectiveness manner, 
      extending beyond the delivery of horizontal recommendations for all. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: The n-of-1 design has been applied to deliver precision exercise 
      interventions, through eHealth and mHealth technologies. Regarding personalized and 
      precision medical nutrition therapy, few trials have implemented dietary 
      manipulations and one series of n-of-1 trials has applied comprehensive genetic data 
      to improve body weight. With regard to anti-obesity medication, pharmacogenetic data 
      could be applied using the n-of-1 trial design, although none have been implemented 
      yet. The n-of-1 clinical trials consist of the only tool for the delivery of 
      evidence-based, personalized obesity treatment (lifestyle and pharmacotherapy), 
      reducing non-responders, while tailoring the best intervention to each patient, 
      through "trial and error". Their application is expected to improve obesity 
      treatment and mitigate the epidemic.

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest types of cancer, and 
      the increasing incidence of PDAC may be related to the prevalence of obesity. 
      Physical activity (PA), a method known to mitigate obesity by increasing total 
      energy expenditure, also modifies multiple cellular pathways associated with cancer 
      hallmarks. Epidemiologic evidence has shown that PA can lower the risk of developing 
      a variety of cancers, reduce some of the detrimental side effects of treatments, and 
      improve patient's quality of life during cancer treatment. However, little is known 
      about the pathways underlying the correlations observed between PA interventions and 
      PDAC. Moreover, there is no standard dose of PA intervention that is ideal for PDAC 
      prevention or as an adjuvant of cancer treatments. In this review, we summarize 
      relevant literature showing how PDAC patients can benefit from PA, the potential of 
      PA as an adjuvant treatment for PDAC, the studies using preclinical models of PDAC 
      to study PA, and the clinical trials to date assessing the effects of PA in PDAC.

TI  - Physical Performance and Non-Esterified Fatty Acids in Men and Women after 
      Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI).
LID - 10.3390/nu14010203 [doi]
LID - 203
AB  - BACKGROUND: Men and women with valvular heart disease have different risk profiles 
      for clinical endpoints. Non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) are possibly involved in 
      cardio-metabolic disease. However, it is unclear whether NEFA concentrations are 
      associated with physical performance in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic 
      valve implantation (TAVI) and whether there are sex-specific effects. METHODS: To 
      test the hypothesis that NEFA concentration is associated with sex-specific physical 
      performance, we prospectively analysed data from one hundred adult patients 
      undergoing TAVI. NEFA concentrations, physical performance and anthropometric 
      parameters were measured before and 6 and 12 months after TAVI. Physical performance 
      was determined by a six-minute walking test (6-MWT) and self-reported weekly bicycle 
      riding time. RESULTS: Before TAVI, NEFA concentrations were higher in patients (44 
      women, 56 men) compared to the normal population. Median NEFA concentrations at 6 
      and 12 months after TAVI were within the reference range reported in the normal 
      population in men but not women. Men but not women presented with an increased 
      performance in the 6-MWT over time (p = 0.026, p = 0.142, respectively). 
      Additionally, men showed an increased ability to ride a bicycle after TAVI compared 
      to before TAVI (p = 0.034). NEFA concentrations before TAVI correlated with the 
      6-MWT before TAVI in women (Spearman's rho -0.552; p = 0.001) but not in men 
      (Spearman's rho -0.007; p = 0.964). No association was found between NEFA 
      concentrations and physical performance 6 and 12 months after TAVI. CONCLUSIONS: 
      NEFA concentrations improved into the reference range in men but not women after 
      TAVI. Men but not women have an increased physical performance after TAVI. No 
      association between NEFA and physical performance was observed in men and women 
      after TAVI.

AB  - Surface electromyography amplitudes are commonly measured in acute sports and 
      exercise science studies to make inferences about muscular strength, performance, 
      and hypertrophic adaptations that may result from different exercises or 
      exercise-related variables. Here, we discuss the presumptive logic and assumptions 
      underlying these inferences, focusing on hypertrophic adaptations for simplicity's 
      sake. We present counter-evidence for each of its premises and discuss evidence both 
      for and against the logical conclusion. Given the limited evidence validating the 
      amplitude of surface electromyograms as a predictor of longitudinal hypertrophic 
      adaptations, coupled with its weak mechanistic foundation, we suggest that acute 
      comparative studies that wish to assess stimulus potency be met with scrutiny.

TI  - Exploring dietitians' practice and views of giving advice on dietary patterns to 
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A qualitative study.
PG  - 179-190
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12939 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dietary guidelines for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) emphasise weight 
      management and individualised total carbohydrate intake. Evidence on the most 
      effective dietary patterns (DPs) for T2DM management is mixed, potentially leading 
      to variations in the advice that dietitians provide. The present study aimed to 
      explore dietitians' practice of DP advice provision to adults with T2DM, as well as 
      understand their views when advising their patients on the DPs deemed effective for 
      glycaemic management or recommended by current guidelines. METHODS: Semi-structured 
      interviews were conducted with 12 UK-registered dietitians, with experience in 
      consulting adults with T2DM. Dietitians were asked for their views on five DPs 
      recommended for glycaemic management of T2DM. Interview transcripts were analysed 
      using deductive and inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Nine themes were 
      identified that draw attention to DP advice provision practices, the five DPs 
      (low-carbohydrate, low-fat, low-glycaemic index, Mediterranean diet and Dietary 
      Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet), other DPs, the barriers and facilitators to 
      DP advice provision and following this advice, and the factors affecting the 
      provision of DP advice. Participants' current practice of DP advice provision to 
      patients with T2DM was perceived to be individualised and patient-centred. 
      Participants discussed their current practice and perceptions of available evidence 
      and how patients respond to advice on the DPs shown to be effective for glycaemic 
      management. Several barriers to providing advice on specific DPs, including safety 
      and compliance challenges, were identified. Participants also highlighted factors 
      that would facilitate the provision of advice on specific DPs and would help 
      patients to follow this advice, including social support, educational resources and 
      more robust scientific evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study 
      provide important insights regarding dietitians' views of promoting whole DPs to 
      patients with T2DM. Emerged barriers and facilitators should be considered when 
      developing future guidance for dietetic practice to support patients with following 
      whole DPs for T2DM management.

TI  - Moderate-intensity exercise training or high-intensity interval training to improve 
      aerobic fitness during exercise prehabilitation in patients planned for elective 
      abdominal cancer surgery?
PG  - 3-13
LID - S0748-7983(21)00698-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ejso.2021.08.026 [doi]
AB  - Low preoperative aerobic fitness is associated with an increased risk of 
      postoperative complications and delayed recovery in patients with abdominal cancer. 
      Surgical prehabilitation aims to increase aerobic fitness preoperatively to improve 
      patient- and treatment-related outcomes. However, an optimal physical exercise 
      training program that is effective within the short time period available for 
      prehabilitation (<6 weeks) has not yet been established. In this comparative review, 
      studies (n = 8) evaluating the effect of short-term (<6 weeks) moderate-intensity 
      exercise training (MIET) or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on objectively 
      measured aerobic fitness were summarized. The content of exercise interventions was 
      critically appraised regarding the frequency, intensity, time, type, volume, and - 
      monitoring of - progression (FITT-VP) principles. Three out of four studies 
      evaluating HIIT showed statistically significant improvements in oxygen uptake at 
      peak exercise (VO(2peak)) by more than 4.9%, the coefficient of variation for 
      VO(2peak). None of the two studies investigating short-term MIET showed 
      statistically significant pre-post changes in VO(2peak). Although short-term HIIT 
      seems to be a promising intervention, concise description of performed exercise 
      based on the FITT-VP principles was rather inconsistent in studies. Hence, 
      interpretation of the results is challenging, and a translation into practical 
      recommendations is premature. More emphasis should be given to individual responses 
      to physical exercise training. Therefore, adequate risk assessment, personalized 
      physical exercise training prescription using the FITT-VP principles, full reporting 
      of physical exercise training adherence, and objective monitoring of training 
      progression and recovery is needed to ensure for a personalized and effective 
      physical exercise training program within a multimodal prehabilitation program.

TI  - Long-Term Adaptations in the Squat, Bench Press and Deadlift: Assessing Strength 
      Gain in Powerlifting Athletes.
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000002858 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Understanding strength changes with resistance training is important in 
      human performance. It also enables better understanding into the expected magnitude 
      of strength increase and factors that influence this change over time. METHODS: 
      Squat (SQ), bench press (BP) and deadlift (DL) scores were collated from 407 
      powerlifting (PL) meets (n = 1896 unique competitors: ~625 females, ~1270 males) 
      between 2003-2018. Absolute (kg) and relative starting strength (kg/body weight) for 
      each lift type was expressed for both sexes. Maximum and overall strength gain/day 
      and /year (kg) was calculated by comparing first and final, or maximum scores for 
      each lift, respectively, and considered based on strength quartile classification. 
      Paired and independent T-tests compared strength changes from baseline and between 
      sexes. One-way ANOVAs compared strength changes between quartiles. Pearson 
      correlations assessed relationships between strength changes over time, and baseline 
      strength, number of competitions and total days competing. RESULTS: Maximum strength 
      adaptations were greater for SQ (20.2-25.4 kg/year) and DL (18.1-21.1 kg/year) 
      compared to BP (10.5-12.8 kg/year, P ≤ 0.001). However, the change in absolute (all 
      lifts: P = 0.247-0.379), and relative strength (all lifts: P = 0.641-0.821) did not 
      differ between sexes. For females, maximum strength gain/day did not differ by 
      quartile (all lifts: P = 0.091-0.746), nor did overall strength gain/day (P = 
      0.151-0.575). Conversely, males in the fourth quartile generally displayed lower 
      maximum and overall strength gain/day. CONCLUSION: These findings show differences 
      in strength gain between upper- and lower-body lifts, but not sex differences in the 
      change in strength. In line with previous research, the strongest males likely gain 
      strength more slowly than weaker counterparts. Professionals should consider this 
      information in the training, assessment and long-term benchmarking of athletes whose 
      sports require a focus on muscular strength.

      study of 102,578 individuals.
LID - 10.1002/acn3.51511 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke has been linked to a lack of physical activity; however, the 
      extent of the association between inactive lifestyles and stroke risk has yet to be 
      characterized across large populations. PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the 
      association between activity-related behaviors and stroke incidence. METHODS: Data 
      from 1999 to 2018 waves of the concurrent cross-sectional National Health and 
      Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were extracted. We analyzed participants 
      characteristics and outcomes for all participants with data on whether they had a 
      stroke or not and assessed how different forms of physical activity affect the 
      incidence of disease. RESULTS: Of the 102,578 individuals included, 3851 had a 
      history of stroke. A range of activity-related behaviors was protective against 
      stroke, including engaging in moderate-intensity work over the last 30 days 
      (OR = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.7-0.9; P = 0.001) and vigorous-intensity work activities over 
      the last 30 days (OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.5-0.8; P < 0.001), and muscle-strengthening 
      exercises (OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.5-0.8; P < 0.001). Conversely, more than 4 h of 
      daily TV, video, or computer use was positively associated with the likelihood of 
      stroke (OR = 11.7, 95% CI = 2.1-219.2; P = 0.022). CONCLUSION: Different types, 
      frequencies, and intensities of physical activity were associated with reduced 
      stroke incidence, implying that there is an option for everyone. Daily or every 
      other day activities are more critical in reducing stroke than reducing sedentary 
      behavior duration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many individuals continued to work from home even after nearly 9 months 
      since the COVID-19 pandemic started in spring of 2020. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a 
      follow-up survey of the faculty and staff of a large Midwest university to determine 
      whether there had been any changes to their home work environment and health 
      outcomes since a prior survey conducted at the start of the pandemic in spring of 
      2020. METHODS: An electronic survey was sent out to all employees, staff, and 
      administration (approximately 10,350 individuals) and was completed by 1,135 
      individuals. RESULTS: It was found that not much had changed after nearly 9 months 
      of working at home. Faculty and staff continued to primarily use laptops without an 
      external keyboard, monitor or mouse. Few participants reported using chairs with 
      adjustable armrests. These conditions continued to result in high levels of body 
      discomfort (49% neck and head, 45% low back, and 62% upper back and shoulders having 
      moderate to severe pain). CONCLUSION: If workers are going to continue to work from 
      home, companies will need to accommodate them with more than a laptop, and should 
      include an external keyboard, monitor, and mouse.

AB  - Body weight management is currently of major concern as the obesity epidemic is 
      still a worldwide challenge. As women face more difficulties to lose weight than 
      men, there is an urgent need to better understand the underlying reasons and 
      mechanisms. Recent data have suggested that the use of oral contraceptive (OC) could 
      be involved. The necessity of utilization and development of contraceptive 
      strategies for birth regulation is undeniable and contraceptive pills appear as a 
      quite easy approach. Moreover, OC also represent a strategy for the management of 
      premenstrual symptoms, acne or bulimia nervosa. The exact impact of OC on body 
      weight remains not clearly established. Thus, after exploring the potential 
      underlying mechanisms by which OC could influence the two side of energy balance, we 
      then provide an overview of the available evidence regarding the effects of OC on 
      energy balance (i.e. energy expenditure and energy intake). Finally, we highlight 
      the necessity for future research to clarify the cellular effects of OC and how the 
      individualization of OC prescriptions can improve long-term weight loss management.

TI  - The association between physical activity and mental health during the first year of 
      the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic affected countries 
      worldwide and has changed peoples' lives. A reduction in physical activity and 
      increased mental health problems were observed, mainly in the first year of the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this systematic review aims to examine the association 
      between physical activity and mental health during the first year of the COVID-19 
      pandemic. METHODS: In July 2021, a search was applied to PubMed, Scopus, and Web of 
      Science. Eligibility criteria included cross-sectional, prospective, and 
      longitudinal study designs and studies published in English; outcomes included 
      physical activity and mental health (e.g., depressive symptoms, anxiety, positive 
      and negative effects, well-being). RESULTS: Thirty-one studies were included in this 
      review. Overall, the studies suggested that higher physical activity is associated 
      with higher well-being, quality of life as well as lower depressive symptoms, 
      anxiety, and stress, independently of age. There was no consensus for the optimal 
      physical activity level for mitigating negative mental symptoms, neither for the 
      frequency nor for the type of physical activity. Women were more vulnerable to 
      mental health changes and men were more susceptive to physical activity changes. 
      CONCLUSION: Physical activity has been a good and effective choice to mitigate the 
      negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health during the first year of 
      the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health policies should alert for possibilities to 
      increase physical activity during the stay-at-home order in many countries 
      worldwide.

TI  - Associations between diet quality and obesity in a nationally representative sample 
      of Iranian households: A cross-sectional study.
PG  - 12-20
LID - 10.1002/osp4.536 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Research examining associations between diet quality and obesity in 
      Iranian adults is limited by small and non-representative samples. This study 
      examined associations between two diet quality indices and obesity risk in a 
      nationally representative sample of Iranian adults and interactions by sex and area 
      of residence. METHODS: Data on 18,307 adults (mean age 37 [SD 15.2] years) were used 
      from the Iranian National Survey 2001-2003. Two diet quality indices (Healthy Eating 
      Index 2015, HEI-2015, and Diet Quality Index International, DQI-I) were calculated 
      from household 24-h dietary recalls. Multi-level regression analyses were used to 
      examine the association between household diet quality and individual-level obesity 
      risk, with interaction terms for sex and area of residence. RESULTS: Higher 
      household HEI-2015 and DQI-I were associated with higher risk of obesity (HEI-2015: 
      relative risk ratio: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.05; DQI-I: relative risk ratio: 1.02, 95% 
      CI: 1.01, 1.02), with stronger effect sizes in adults living in rural areas. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Higher diet quality (HEI-2015 and DQI-I) was associated with higher 
      obesity risk, which was stronger in adults living in rural areas. Due to the 
      complexity of examining these associations in a Middle Eastern country undergoing a 
      nutrition transition, longitudinal research is needed to confirm these findings.

TI  - Airflow restriction mask induces greater central fatigue after a non-exhaustive 
      high-intensity interval exercise.
PG  - 487-497

AB  - The airflow restriction mask (ARM) is a practical and inexpensive device for 
      respiratory muscle training. Wearing an ARM has recently been combined with 
      high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE), but its effect on neuromuscular fatigue is 
      unknown. The present study investigated the effects of ARM wearing on neuromuscular 
      fatigue after an HIIE session. Fourteen healthy men performed two HIIE sessions 
      (4 × 4 min at 90% HR(max) , 3 min recovery at 70% HR(max) ) with or without an ARM. 
      Neuromuscular fatigue was quantified via pre- to post-HIIE changes in maximal 
      voluntary contraction (MVC), voluntary activation (VA, central fatigue), and 
      potentialized evoked twitch force at 100, 10, and 1 Hz (peripheral fatigue). Blood 
      pH and lactate were measured before and after the HIIE session, while HR, SpO(2) , 
      dyspnea, physical sensation of effort (P-RPE), and Task Effort and Awareness (TEA) 
      were recorded every bout. The exercise-induced decrease in MVC was higher (p < 0.05) 
      in the ARM (-28 ± 12%) than in the Control condition (-20 ± 11%). The VA decreased 
      (p < 0.05) in the ARM (-11 ± 11%) but not in the control condition (-4 ± 5%, 
      p > 0.05). Pre- to post-HIIE declines in evoked twitch at 100, 10, and 1 Hz were 
      similar (p > 0.05) between ARM and control conditions (ARM: -18 ± 10, -43 ± 11 and 
      -38 ± 12%; Control: -18 ± 14, -43 ± 12 and -37 ± 17%). When compared with the 
      control, the HIIE bout wearing ARM was marked by higher heart rate, plasma lactate 
      concentration, dyspnea, P-RPE and TEA, as well as lower SpO(2) and blood pH. In 
      conclusion, ARM increases perceptual and physiological stress during a HIIE, which 
      may lead to a greater post-exercise central fatigue.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Glutamine can be beneficial to athletes for its antiinflammatory and 
      antioxidant effects. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of 
      glutamine supplementation on some atherosclerosis markers after exhaustive exercise 
      in young healthy males. METHODS: In an intervention study, 30 healthy males 
      (case = 15 and control = 15) were randomly assigned into two groups. For 14 d, the 
      intervention group received 0.3 g of glutamine per kilogram of body weight per day, 
      with 25 g of sugar in 250 mL of water, and the control group received 25 g of sugar 
      per 250 mL of water. At the end of the intervention, the participants completed one 
      session of exhaustive exercise, and then fasting blood samples were taken to test 
      serum levels of atherosclerosis markers. RESULTS: In the intervention group, the 
      serum levels of leptin, cholesterol, and oxidized low-density lipoprotein were lower 
      than in the control group after 2 wk of glutamine supplementation (P < 0.05). 
      Interleukin-6 serum levels were lower in the intervention group compared to the 
      control group after supplementation, but not significantly. Serum levels of leptin, 
      interleukin-6, cholesterol, and oxidized low-density lipoprotein, as well as the 
      ratio of oxidized low-density lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein, were 
      significantly decreased in the intervention group compared to the control group 
      after exhaustive exercise (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Glutamine supplementation has 
      beneficial effects for athletes, particularly those doing strenuous physical 
      exercise, through reducing atherosclerosis-related biomarkers and elevating serum 
      adiponectin levels, and it can potentially play a role in decreasing the initiation 
      and progression of atherosclerosis.

TI  - Rural-Urban Differences in Physical Activity Tracking and Engagement in a Web-Based 
      Platform.
PG  - 333549211065522
LID - 10.1177/00333549211065522 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Despite the well-established health benefits of regular participation in 
      physical activity, most adults do not meet recommended exercise guidelines. In rural 
      communities, limited local resources and geographic dispersion make engaging in 
      regular activity particularly difficult. Web-based solutions offer a potential 
      solution for addressing physical activity disparities between rural and urban areas. 
      METHODS: This study examined the physical activity logs of users (n = 6695) of a 
      web-based platform called Walk Georgia, comparing residents of metropolitan and 
      nonmetropolitan areas. We tabulated descriptive statistics for variables of 
      interest, cross-tabulated for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan groups. We then used 
      independent-samples t tests to compare logged activity between metropolitan and 
      nonmetropolitan residing user groups. RESULTS: In the analysis of group type (n = 
      6654), users were more likely to enroll in the program as part of a group than as 
      individuals (n = 4391; 65.9%), particularly for users in metropolitan areas (3558 of 
      5192; 68.5%). Although the groups shared certain activities, nonmetropolitan 
      residents were more likely than metropolitan residents to engage in 
      maintenance-based activities. Nonmetropolitan residents earned fewer program points 
      for their activity than metropolitan users (P = .007), largely because of lower 
      average exercise difficulty (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The web-based platform was 
      effective in helping individuals track physical activity. Despite engaging in 
      similar amounts of physical activity by time, on average, users in nonmetropolitan 
      areas engaged in less rigorous and more maintenance-based tasks than users in 
      metropolitan areas. One strategy for increasing physical activity among rural 
      populations may be to leverage social support provided by group enrollment in such 
      programming.

      Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

LID - 331
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences, including social isolation, movement 
      restrictions and work instability have altered many people's nutritional behaviors 
      and daily lifestyle. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of the 
      COVID-19 pandemic on selected eating habits, physical activity and daily lifestyle 
      changes of Polish adults (n = 145). The self-designed and anonymous questionnaire 
      was available online from the 1 May 2021 to the 15 May 2021. In general, 60% of 
      respondents declared that the COVID-19 pandemic did not affect their dietary habits, 
      whereas 26% of surveyed individuals answered in the affirmative. The effect of the 
      COVID-19 pandemic on changing dietary habits was differentiated by age (Pearson's 
      χ(2) = 12.604; p = 0.0134). The number of meals consumed by respondents per day 
      differed across gender groups (Pearson's χ(2) = 9.653; df = 4; p = 0.0466). An 
      increase in body weight during the COVID-19 pandemic was reported by 43% of women 
      and 7.6% of surveyed men. Additionally, hybrid working women declared most often an 
      increase in body mass independent of age, education level and living place. 
      Moreover, the majority of respondents who reported the effect of the pandemic on 
      changing dietary habits also declared more frequent sweets consumption. The study 
      revealed that respondents who stated more frequent sweets consumption during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic were more likely associated with an increase in body mass (OR = 
      6.75, 95% CI, 6.75-91.25). No increase in the consumption of vitamin D, C and Mg 
      supplements and pickled products was found.

TI  - A mixed-methods study of American Millennials' views about celebrity endorsement of 
      foods and beverages.
LID - daab048 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/heapro/daab048 [doi]
AB  - More than one-third of American Millennial adults have obesity, and a significant 
      amount of their household budget is spent on purchasing energy-dense and 
      nutrient-poor food and beverage products. Consumers' brand awareness and purchasing 
      behaviors are influenced by celebrity credibility measured by trustworthiness, 
      expertise and attractiveness; and celebrity 'fit' between products, brands and 
      consumer' self-image. This empirical mixed-methods study combined Q methodology with 
      questionnaires to explore the shared and distinct viewpoints of demographically 
      diverse Millennial adults about celebrity endorsement of food and beverage products 
      or marketing campaigns in the United States (USA). Millennials (n = 40; aged 
      26-39 years) sorted photo images (n = 48) of US celebrities associated with branded 
      food and beverage product endorsements on a 9-point normal distribution scale from 
      'most trusted' (+4) to 'most distrusted' (-4). Participants also completed a 4-item 
      post Q-sort questionnaire to interpret their thoughts during the card sorting 
      process, and a 3-item questionnaire to examine their views about celebrity 
      credibility, 'fit' and multiple brand and product endorsements. Three distinct 
      viewpoints were identified that included: (i) healthy lifestyle champions who 
      trusted celebrities associated with healthy products or campaigns; (ii) female 
      role-model admirers who trusted female celebrities associated with positive social 
      impacts and (ii) African-American celebrity fans who trusted African-American 
      celebrities who endorsed any brand or products. Qualitative analysis of the 
      questionnaire identified the potential negative influence of celebrity endorsement 
      for unhealthy products on Millennials' dietary behaviors. Businesses and 
      organizations should carefully select credible celebrities trusted by Millennials to 
      encourage food and beverage products associated with a healthy diet.

TI  - Multimodal Preventive Trial for Alzheimer's Disease: MIND-ADmini Pilot Trial Study 
      Design and Progress.
PG  - 30-39
LID - 10.14283/jpad.2022.4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interventions simultaneously targeting multiple risk factors and 
      mechanisms are most likely to be effective in preventing cognitive impairment. This 
      was indicated in the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive 
      Impairment and Disability (FINGER) testing a multidomain lifestyle intervention 
      among at-risk individuals. The importance of medical food at the early symptomatic 
      disease stage, prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD), was emphasized in the LipiDiDiet 
      trial. The feasibility and effects of multimodal interventions in prodromal AD are 
      unclear. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility of an adapted FINGER-based 
      multimodal lifestyle intervention, with or without medical food, among individuals 
      with prodromal AD. METHODS: MIND-ADmini is a multinational proof-of-concept 6-month 
      randomized controlled trial (RCT), with four trial sites (Sweden, Finland, Germany, 
      France). The trial targeted individuals with prodromal AD defined using the 
      International Working Group-1 criteria, and with vascular or lifestyle-related risk 
      factors. The parallel-group RCT includes three arms: 1) multimodal lifestyle 
      intervention (nutritional guidance, exercise, cognitive training, vascular/metabolic 
      risk management and social stimulation); 2) multimodal lifestyle 
      intervention+medical food (Fortasyn Connect); and 3) regular health advice/care 
      (control group). Primary outcomes are feasibility and adherence. Secondary outcomes 
      are adherence to the individual intervention domains and healthy lifestyle changes. 
      RESULTS: Screening began on 28 September 2017 and was completed on 21 May 2019. 
      Altogether 93 participants were randomized and enrolled. The intervention proceeded 
      as planned. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, this pilot trial tests the feasibility 
      and adherence to a multimodal lifestyle intervention, alone or combined with medical 
      food, among individuals with prodromal AD. It can serve as a model for combination 
      therapy trials (non-pharma, nutrition-based and/or pharmacological interventions).

TI  - Leisure-time physical activity and incidence of objectively assessed hearing loss: 
      The Niigata Wellness Study.
PG  - 435-445
LID - 10.1111/sms.14089 [doi]
AB  - Previous cohort study reported that high physical activity was associated with a low 
      risk of self-reported hearing loss in women. However, no studies have examined the 
      association between physical activity and the development of hearing loss as 
      measured using an objective assessment of hearing loss in men and women. Here, we 
      used cohort data to examine the association between leisure-time physical activity 
      and incidence of objectively assessed hearing loss in men and women. Participants 
      included 27 537 Japanese adults aged 20-80 years without hearing loss, who completed 
      a self-administered physical activity questionnaire between April 2001 and March 
      2002. The participants were followed up for the development of hearing loss as 
      measured by audiometry between April 2002 and March 2008. During follow-up, 3691 
      participants developed hearing loss. Compared with the none physical activity group, 
      multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for developing hearing loss were 0.93 
      (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.86-1.01) and 0.87 (0.81-0.95) for the medium 
      (<525 MET-min/week) and high (≥525 MET-min/week) physical activity groups, 
      respectively (p for trend = 0.001). The magnitude of risk reduction was slightly 
      greater in vigorous-intensity activity than in moderate-intensity activity (p for 
      interaction = 0.01). Analysis by sound frequency showed that the amount of physical 
      activity was inversely associated with high frequency hearing loss development (p 
      for trend <0.001), but not with low frequency hearing loss development (p for 
      trend = 0.19). Higher level of leisure-time physical activity was associated with 
      lower incidence of hearing loss, particularly for vigorous-intensity activities and 
      high sound frequencies.

TI  - Position guidelines and evidence base concerning determinants of childhood obesity 
      with a European perspective.
PG  - e13391
LID - 10.1111/obr.13391 [doi]
AB  - Childhood obesity is one of the most pressing global public health issues, with 
      rates increasing fastest in countries at low levels of income. Obesity occurring 
      during childhood is likely to persist throughout the life course, and it is a cause 
      of increased disease risk from the early years of life. This supplement is the 
      result of collaborations involving a large and multidisciplinary group of 
      researchers that were established in the context of the ongoing European Horizon 
      2020 project Science and Technology in childhood Obesity Policy (STOP). The aim, as 
      in the entire STOP project, is to generate evidence that can support better policies 
      to tackle the problem of childhood obesity in Europe and elsewhere. Quality of life 
      and health well-being concerning children needs to consider personalized, 
      population, and planetary facets to tackle childhood obesity at early stages of 
      life, for in-deep phenotyping, integrating personalized medicine and precision 
      public health interventions at global levels. This supplement contributes to this 
      aim.

TI  - The Relationship between Body Composition, Dietary Intake, Physical Activity, and 
      Pulmonary Status in Adolescents and Adults with Cystic Fibrosis.
LID - 10.3390/nu14020310 [doi]
LID - 310
AB  - Measures of body fat and lean mass may better predict important clinical outcomes in 
      patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) than body mass index (BMI). Little is known about 
      how diet quality and exercise may impact body composition in these patients. Dual 
      X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) body composition, 24-h dietary recall, and physical 
      activity were assessed in a cross-sectional analysis of 38 adolescents and adults 
      with CF and 19 age-, race-, and gender-matched healthy volunteers. Compared with the 
      healthy volunteers, participants with CF had a lower appendicular lean mass index 
      (ALMI), despite no observed difference in BMI, and their diets consisted of higher 
      glycemic index foods with a greater proportion of calories from fat and a lower 
      proportion of calories from protein. In participants with CF, pulmonary function 
      positively correlated with measures of lean mass, particularly ALMI, and negatively 
      correlated with multiple measures of body fat after controlling for age, gender, and 
      BMI. Higher physical activity levels were associated with greater ALMI and lower 
      body fat. In conclusion, body composition measures, particularly ALMI, may better 
      predict key clinical outcomes in individuals with CF than BMI. Future longitudinal 
      studies analyzing the effect of dietary intake and exercise on body composition and 
      CF-specific clinical outcomes are needed.

TI  - Lifestyle Variations during and after the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study 
      of Diet, Physical Activities, and Weight Gain among the Jordanian Adult Population.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19031346 [doi]
LID - 1346
AB  - The way that COVID-19 has been handled since its inception in 2019 has had a 
      significant impact on lifestyle-related behaviors, such as physical activities, 
      diet, and sleep patterns. This study measures lifestyle-related behavior during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic lockdown using a 22-item questionnaire. The responses were 
      collected from March 2021 to September 2021. A total of four hundred and sixty-seven 
      Jordanian participants were engaged in assessing the changes caused by the pandemic 
      and their effect on BMI. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire were 
      tested for 71 participants. Cronbach's alpha values for the questionnaire exceeded 
      0.7, demonstrating good reliability and internal consistency. The effect of each 
      question regarding physical activity and dietary habits over the BMI difference was 
      studied using ANOVA. The study shows that more than half of the participants 
      reported snacking more between meals and increased their sitting and screen time, 
      while 74% felt more stressed and anxious. BMI difference among the individuals 
      throughout the lockdown was significantly associated with these variables. In 
      contrast, 62% of the participants showed more awareness about their health by 
      increasing the intake of immunity-boosting foods, and 56% of the participants showed 
      an increase in the consumption of nutrition supplements. Females and married 
      individuals tended to be healthier. Therefore, their BMI showed stability compared 
      to others based on their gender and marital status. Exercise, sleep, and avoiding 
      'junk' food, which contributes to weight gain and COVID-19 vulnerability, are 
      strongly recommended.

TI  - Association among length of residence, physical activity, and obesity in the US 
      immigrants: A regression-based mediation analysis.
PG  - e23576
LID - 10.1002/ajhb.23576 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the mediated relationship between objectively measured 
      obesity, accelerometer-based moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and 
      length of residence among US immigrants. METHODS: A total of 885 adults (≥18 years) 
      who were born outside the United States from the 2003 to 2006 National Health and 
      Nutrition Examination Survey were included in the analysis. The participants were 
      categorized into two groups (i.e., living in the United States ≥15 years vs. 
      <15 years). MVPA time (minutes/day) was measured by ActiGraph accelerometry. Obesity 
      was defined as body fat percentage measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. 
      Regression-based mediation analysis was conducted using SURVEY procedures in SAS 
      version 9.4. RESULTS: When controlling for covariates, immigrants living in the 
      United States for ≥15 years were significantly less likely to spend time 
      participating in MVPA (c; β = -4.50, p = .04), and more likely to be at high risk of 
      obesity (a; β = 1.70, p = .01) compared to those living in the United States for 
      <15 years. Also, the relationship between obesity and MVPA was statistically 
      significant (b; β = -0.80, p = .003). Length of residence was indirectly associated 
      with MVPA (ab; β = -1.37, p = .03), suggesting that obesity mediated the association 
      of length of residence on MVPA (c'; β = -3.13, p = .20). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity 
      mediated the association between length of residence and MVPA in the US immigrants. 
      These findings may encourage long-term US immigrants to prevent and treat obesity 
      for increasing the amount of MVPA time.

TI  - Adding Estimated Cardiorespiratory Fitness to the Framingham Risk Score and 
      Mortality Risk in a Korean Population-Based Cohort Study.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19010510 [doi]
LID - 510
AB  - BACKGROUND: The added value of non-exercise-based estimation of cardiorespiratory 
      fitness (eCRF) to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors for mortality risk has 
      not been examined in Korean populations. METHODS: This population-based prospective 
      cohort study examined the relationship of the 10-year Framingham risk score (FRS) 
      for CVD risk and eCRF with all-cause and CVD mortality in a representative sample of 
      Korean adults aged 30 years and older. Data regarding a total of 38,350 participants 
      (16,505 men/21,845 women) were obtained from the 2007-2015 Korea National Health and 
      Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). All-cause and CVD mortality were the main 
      outcomes. The 10-year FRS point sum and eCRF level were the main exposures. RESULTS: 
      All-cause and CVD mortality was positively correlated with the 10-year FRS point 
      summation and inversely correlated with eCRF level in this study population. The 
      protective of high eCRF against all-cause and CVD mortality was more prominent in 
      the middle and high FRS category than in the low FRS category. Notably, the FRS plus 
      eCRF model has better predictor power for estimating mortality risk compared to the 
      FRS only model. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings indicate that eCRF can be used as 
      an alternative to objectively measured CRF for mortality risk prediction.

TI  - Is there an association between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cognitive 
      function? A systematic review.
PG  - 47
LID - 10.1186/s12877-021-02721-w [doi]
LID - 47
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is represented as the most 
      common liver disease worldwide. NAFLD is associated with metabolic risk factors 
      underpinned by insulin resistance, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, leading 
      to extrahepatic changes in central nervous diseases such as cognitive impairment, 
      Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The aim of the review is to explore the 
      association between NAFLD and cognitive function. METHODS: Using the PRISMA 
      guidelines, a systematic electronic literature search was conducted in four 
      databases: MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Embase and CINAHL from inception until March 2021. 
      Neuropsychological tests utilised within each study were grouped into relevant 
      cognitive domains including 'general cognition', 'reasoning', 'mental speed, 
      attention and psychomotor speed', 'memory and learning', 'language', 'visuospatial 
      perception' and 'ideas, abstraction, figural creations and mental flexibility'. 
      RESULTS: Eleven observational studies that involved 7978 participants with a mean 
      age of 51 years were included. Those with NAFLD had poor cognitive performance in 
      three cognitive domains, including 'general cognition', 'mental speed, attention and 
      psychomotor speed', and 'ideas, abstraction, figural creations and mental 
      flexibility'. CONCLUSION: The observed results from the 11 included studies showed 
      that NAFLD was associated with lower cognitive performance across several domains. 
      However, studies conducted to date are limited to observational designs and are 
      heterogeneous with varying diagnostic tools used to assess cognitive function. TRIAL

TI  - A multifactorial interdisciplinary intervention to prevent functional and mobility 
      decline for more participation in (pre-)frail community-dwelling older adults 
      (PromeTheus): study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 124
LID - 10.1186/s12877-022-02783-4 [doi]
LID - 124
AB  - BACKGROUND: Age-related decline in physical capacity can lead to frailty, associated 
      with an increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes and greater healthcare 
      utilization. In an aging population, effective strategies to prevent physical 
      decline and frailty, and preserve independence are needed. Prevention programs for 
      vulnerable community-dwelling older adults are, however, often not yet established 
      and implemented in routine practice. Research on the feasibility, implementation, 
      and (cost-)effectiveness of multifactorial, interdisciplinary intervention programs 
      that take advantage of available services of healthcare providers is also limited. 
      The main aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of such an intervention 
      program (PromeTheus) to prevent functional and mobility decline for more 
      participation in community-dwelling (pre-)frail older adults. METHODS: The study is 
      designed as a three-center, randomized controlled trial with a 12-month intervention 
      period. Four hundred community-dwelling (pre-)frail (Clinical Frailty Scale score 
      4-6) older adults (≥70 years) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention 
      group (IG) or the control group (CG). The IG will receive the PromeTheus program 
      consisting of obligatory home-based physical exercises (Weight-bearing Exercise for 
      Better Balance) accompanied by physiotherapists and facultative counseling services 
      (person-environment-fit, coping with everyday life, nutrition, group-based 
      activities) delivered via existing healthcare structures (e.g., social workers, 
      nutritionists). The CG will receive usual care and a one-time counseling session on 
      recommendations for physical activity and nutrition. Primary outcomes assessed at 
      months 6 and 12 are the function component of the Late-Life Function and Disability 
      Instrument and the University of Alabama at Birmingham Life-Space Assessment. 
      Secondary outcomes are disability, physical capacity and activity, frailty, 
      nutritional status, falls, fear of falling, health status, and psychosocial 
      components. Process and economic evaluations are also conducted. Primary statistical 
      analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. DISCUSSION: Compared to 
      usual care, the PromeTheus program is expected to result in higher function and 
      mobility, greater independence and lower need for care, and more participation. As 
      the PromeTheus program draws on existing German healthcare structures, its 
      large-scale translation and delivery will be feasible, if evidence of 
      (cost-)effectiveness and successful implementation can be demonstrated. TRIAL

TI  - Goldilocks Days: optimising children's time use for health and well-being.
PG  - 301-308
LID - 10.1136/jech-2021-216686 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One size rarely fits all in population health. Differing outcomes may 
      compete for best allocations of time. Among children aged 11-12 years, we aimed to 
      (1) describe optimal 24-hour time use for diverse physical, cognitive/academic and 
      well-being outcomes, (2) pinpoint the 'Goldilocks Day' that optimises all outcomes 
      and (3) develop a tool to customise time-use recommendations. METHODS: In 2004, the 
      Longitudinal Study of Australian Children recruited a nationally-representative 
      cohort of 5107 infants with biennial follow-up waves. We used data from the 
      cross-sectional Child Health CheckPoint module (2015-2016, n=1874, 11-12 years, 51% 
      males). Time use was from 7-day 24-hour accelerometry. Outcomes included life 
      satisfaction, psychosocial health, depressive symptoms, emotional problems, 
      non-verbal IQ; vocabulary, academic performance, adiposity, fitness, blood pressure, 
      inflammatory biomarkers, bone strength. Relationships between time use and outcomes 
      were modelled using compositional regression. RESULTS: Optimal daily durations 
      varied widely for different health outcomes (sleep: 8.3-11.4 hours; sedentary: 
      7.3-12.2 hours; light physical activity: 1.7-5.1 hours; moderate-to-vigorous 
      physical activity (MVPA): 0.3-2.7 hours, all models p≤0.04). In general, days with 
      highest physical activity (predominantly MVPA) and low sedentary time were optimal 
      for physical health, while days with highest sleep and lowest sedentary time were 
      optimal for mental health. Days with highest sedentary time and lowest physical 
      activity were optimal for cognitive health. The overall Goldilocks Day had 10 hours 
      21 min sleep, 9 hours 44 min sedentary time, 2 hours 26 min light physical activity 
      and 1 hour 29 min MVPA. Our interactive interface allows personalisation of 
      Goldilocks Days to an individual's outcome priorities. CONCLUSION: 'Goldilocks Days' 
      necessitate compromises based on hierarchies of priorities for health, social and 
      economic outcomes.

TI  - Disparities in Vitamin D Status of Newborn Infants from a Diverse Sociodemographic 
      Population in Montreal, Canada.
PG  - 255-268
LID - 10.1093/jn/nxab344 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D status at birth is reliant on maternal-fetal transfer of 
      vitamin D during gestation. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to examine the vitamin D status of 
      newborn infants in a diverse population and to subsequently identify the modifiable 
      correlates of vitamin D status. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, healthy 
      mother-infant dyads (n = 1035) were recruited within 36 h after term delivery (March 
      2016-March 2019). Demographic and lifestyle factors were surveyed. Newborn serum 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was measured (standardized chemiluminescence 
      immunoassay) and categorized as deficient [serum 25(OH)D <30 nmol/L] or adequate 
      (≥40 nmol/L). Serum 25(OH)D was compared among categories of maternal 
      characteristics using ANOVA; each characteristic was tested in a separate model. 
      Subgroups (use of multivitamins preconception and continued in pregnancy compared 
      with during pregnancy only) were matched (n = 352/group) for maternal factors 
      (ancestry, age, income, education, parity, and prepregnancy BMI) using propensity 
      scores; logistic regression models were generated for odds of deficiency or 
      adequacy. RESULTS: Infants' mean serum 25(OH)D was 45.9 nmol/L (95% CI: 44.7, 47.0 
      nmol/L) (n = 1035), with 20.8% (95% CI: 18.3%, 23.2%) deficient and 60.7% (95% CI: 
      55.2%, 66.2%) adequate. Deficiency prevalence ranged from 14.6% of white infants to 
      41.7% of black infants. Serum 25(OH)D was higher (P < 0.0001) in infants of mothers 
      with higher income, BMI < 25 kg/m2, exercise and sun exposure in pregnancy, and use 
      of multivitamins preconception. In the matched-subgroup analysis, multivitamin 
      supplementation preconception plus during pregnancy relative to only during 
      pregnancy was associated with lower odds for vitamin D deficiency (ORadj: 0.55; 95% 
      CI: 0.36, 0.86) and higher odds for adequate vitamin D status (ORadj: 1.47; 95% CI: 
      1.04, 2.07). CONCLUSIONS: In this study most newborn infants had adequate vitamin D 
      status, yet one-fifth were vitamin D deficient with disparities between population 
      groups. Guidelines for a healthy pregnancy recommend maternal use of multivitamins 
      preconception and continuing in pregnancy. An emphasis on preconception use may help 
      to achieve adequate neonatal vitamin D status.This trial was registered at 
      clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02563015.

PG  - 2460

AB  - There is limited evidence regarding the possible role of dietary acid load (DAL) in 
      the pathophysiology of migraine headaches. Therefore, we sought to examine DAL in 
      relation to the clinical features of migraine including headache frequency, severity 
      and duration, headache impact test-6 (HIT-6), and serum levels of nitric oxide (NO). 
      In the present cross-sectional study, 262 patients (38 men and 224 women aged 
      20-50 years) were recruited through a simple random sampling method. Dietary intakes 
      were obtained by using a validated 168-item semi-quantitative food frequency 
      questionnaire (FFQ). DAL was then calculated by two different methods; potential 
      renal acid load (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP). In total, 262 
      patients with a mean (SE) age of 36.1 (0.53) and a BMI of 25.55 (0.21) were included 
      in the current study. After controlling for potential confounders, a higher DAL was 
      positively associated with headache frequency in those with the highest DAL score 
      compared to the lowest (PRAL; β = 2.33; 95% CI 0.78, 3.88; NEAP; β = 1.74; 95% CI 
      0.13, 3.34). Increasing NEAP from 28.96 to 35.89 resulted in a 3.43 and 2.74 
      increment in HIT-6 scores in the crude (95% CI 1.35, 5.52) and fully-adjusted models 
      (95% CI 0.40, 5.07), respectively. Moreover, a higher dietary PRAL was significantly 
      associated with migraine-related disability, as shown by HIT-6, in subjects of the 
      third tertile compared to those in the first tertile after controlling for 
      confounders (β = 2.42; 95% CI 0.13, 4.70). In conclusion, our study highlighted the 
      importance of the acid-base properties of a diet in the pathophysiology of migraine 
      headaches. However, further well-designed studies are needed to confirm our 
      findings.

TI  - A 16-week multicomponent exercise training program improves menopause-related 
      symptoms in middle-aged women. The FLAMENCO project randomized control trial.
LID - 10.1097/GME.0000000000001947 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of a supervised multicomponent exercise 
      training program on menopause-related symptoms, particularly vasomotor symptoms 
      (VMS), in middle-aged women. METHODS: A total of 112 middle-aged women (mean age 
      52 ± 4 y old, age range 45-60 y) from the FLAMENCO project (exercise [n = 59] and 
      counseling [n = 53] groups) participated in this randomized controlled trial 
      (per-protocol basis). The exercise group followed a multicomponent exercise program 
      composed of 60-minute sessions 3 days per week for 16 weeks. The 15-item Cervantes 
      Menopause and Health Subscale was used to assess the frequency of menopause-related 
      symptoms. RESULTS: After adjusting for body mass index and Mediterranean diet 
      adherence, the subscales measuring menopause-related symptoms and VMSs decreased 4.6 
      more in the exercise group compared to the counseling group (between-group 
      differences [B]: 95% CI: -8.8 to -0.2; P = 0.040). The exercise group also showed 
      significant improvements in the subscales of couple relationships (between-group 
      differences [B]: -1.87: 95% CI: -3.29 to -0.45; P = 0.010), psychological state 
      (between-group differences [B]: -2.3: 95% CI: -5 to -0.2; P = 0.035), and VMSs 
      (between-group differences [B]: -4.5: 95% CI: -8.8 to -0.2; p = 0.040) in the 
      Cervantes Menopause and Health Subscale compared with the counseling group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A 16-week multicomponent physical exercise program showed a positive 
      effect on menopause-related symptoms especially in couple relationships, 
      psychological state, and VMS, among 45 to 60 year old women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Regular exercise positively affects cardiovascular physiology, 
      translating into the adequate capacity of microvascular blood vessels to dilate in 
      response to acute bouts of exercise. However, this remains unstudied in patients 
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who often suffer from 
      cardiovascular comorbidity. Therefore, we studied acute changes in retinal blood 
      vessel diameters in response to high-intensity exercise in patients with COPD. The 
      effect of an exercise-based 8-week pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program was 
      evaluated. We consider changes in these retinal metrics as an indicator of 
      microvascular reactivity. METHODS: Demographics and clinical characteristics of 41 
      patients were collected at the start and end of the PR program. Patients performed a 
      high-intensity exercise test on a cycle ergometer at the start and end of the PR 
      program, during which we collected retinal images. Fundus images were taken 
      immediately before and 0, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min after the ergometer test. Widths of 
      retinal blood vessels, represented as Central Retinal Arteriolar and Venular 
      Equivalents (CRAE and CRVE), were calculated. RESULTS: Thirty patients with COPD 
      completed the study protocol (57% males; mean age: 64 ± 7 years; mean FEV(1): 
      45 ± 17%pred). We did not observe a change in retinal vessel widths following the 
      ergometer test at the start of the PR program. This null result remained at the end 
      of the 8-week PR program. Our observations did not alter when considering responders 
      and non-responders to PR. CONCLUSION: Retinal blood vessel diameters of patients 
      with COPD did not change following an exercise test on an ergometer. The 
      exercise-based PR program of eight weeks did not counteract the blunted retinal 
      microvascular response.

TI  - Daily and Not Every-Other-Day Intake of Anthocyanin-Rich New Zealand Blackcurrant 
      Extract Alters Substrate Oxidation during Moderate-Intensity Walking in Adult Males.
PG  - 49-61
LID - 10.1080/19390211.2020.1841356 [doi]
AB  - Daily intake of anthocyanin-rich New Zealand blackcurrant (NZBC) extract can enhance 
      exercise-induced fat oxidation. It is not known whether habitual dietary anthocyanin 
      intake and body composition affects blackcurrant-induced fat oxidation or even if 
      daily intake is required. We examined effects of daily and every-other-day intake of 
      NZBC extract on metabolic and physiological responses during moderate-intensity 
      walking. Sixteen physically active males (age: 24 ± 6 yr, body mass: 78 ± 16 kg, 
      BMI: 24.7 ± 4.2 kg·m(-2), body fat: 15.2 ± 5.0%) volunteered. A randomized, 
      cross-over design with a control condition was used and habitual dietary anthocyanin 
      intake quantified. For intake conditions, participants consumed two capsules of NZBC 
      extract (i.e. 210 mg of anthocyanins, CurraNZ™) with breakfast daily or 
      every-other-day for 14 days (14-D and 14-EOD) with 14-days washout. Final two 
      capsules were taken 2-hr before the walk (speed: 5.7 ± 0.7 km·hr(-1)). There was a 
      trend for lower respiratory exchange ratio and carbohydrate oxidation with changes 
      only for 14-D. Fat oxidation was increased only for 14-D (p < 0.05) with 50% of the 
      participants more than a 10% change. In 14-D, there was a positive correlation for 
      BMI and body fat % with the absolute change in fat oxidation but not with habitual 
      dietary anthocyanin intake. Daily intake of NZBC extract is required to enhance 
      exercise-induced fat oxidation. Enhanced exercise-induced fat oxidation by daily 
      intake of NZBC extract is related to body composition but not to habitual dietary 
      anthocyanin intake in physically active males. Daily anthocyanin intake seems to be 
      required to allow the gradual build-up and maintenance of anthocyanin-derived 
      metabolites that are required to alter mechanisms for exercise-induced substrate 
      oxidation.

TI  - Examination of the Allostatic Load Construct and Its Longitudinal Association With 
      Health Outcomes in the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study.
PG  - 104-115
LID - 10.1097/PSY.0000000000001013 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite evidence on allostatic load (AL) as a model explaining 
      associations between stress and disease, there is no consensus on its 
      operationalization. This study aimed to contrast various AL constructs and their 
      longitudinal associations with disease and disability. METHODS: Baseline and 5-year 
      follow-up data from 738 adults participating in the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study 
      were used. Five AL scores were created by summing the presence of 21 dysregulated 
      multisystem physiological parameters using the following: a) z scores, b) 
      population-based quartile cutoffs, c) clinical-based cutoffs, d) 10 preselected 
      clinical-based cutoffs (AL-reduced), and e) 12 clinical-based cutoffs selected a 
      posteriori based on association with disease (AL-select). Adjusted logistic 
      regression models examined associations between each AL score at baseline and 5-year 
      incident type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD), activities (or 
      instrumental activities) of daily living (ADL; IADL) for physical impairment, and 
      cognitive impairment. RESULTS: AL-quartile was associated with greater odds of T2D 
      (odds ratio [OR] = 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07-1.35) and CVD (OR = 
      1.14; 95% CI = 1.06-1.22). AL-reduced was associated with higher odds of IADL (OR = 
      1.21; 95% CI = 1.07-1.37) and AL-clinical with CVD (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.07-1.21), 
      IADL (OR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.04-1.19), and ADL (OR = 1.15; 95% CI = 1.04-1.26). 
      AL-select showed associations with T2D (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 1.14-1.61), CVD (OR = 
      1.21; 95% CI = 1.11-1.32), IADL (OR = 1.15; 95% CI = 1.04-1.26), and ADL (OR = 1.24; 
      95% CI = 1.08-1.41). No associations were found with AL z-score. CONCLUSIONS: AL 
      scores computed with clinical-based cutoffs performed robustly in our sample of 
      mainland Puerto Ricans, whereas z scores did not predict disease and disability. 
      AL-select was the most consistent predictor, supporting its use as a 
      disease-predicting model. Future assessment of AL-select in other populations may 
      help operationalize AL.

AB  - Introduction: To develop sex- and age-specific percentile curves for seven physical 
      fitness components for Chinese Han children and adolescents aged 7-18 years based on 
      the total and the normal weight population using a nationally representative sample. 
      Methods: A total of 214,228 Chinese Han children and adolescents aged 7-18 years old 
      with all nutritional status and 161,999 with normal weight were examined. Seven 
      physical fitness components [forced vital capacity (FVC), standing long jump (SLJ), 
      50-m dash, sit-and-reach (SR), grip strength (GS), body muscle strength (BMS), and 
      endurance running (ER)] were measured, and percentile curves for each physical 
      fitness component at the 20th, 40th, 60th, and 80th percentiles were calculated 
      using the general additive model for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS). Results: 
      Physical fitness presents different characteristics in each subgroup of sex, age, 
      and nutritional status among children and adolescents. Sex- and age-specific 
      percentiles for the seven physical fitness components among the Chinese Han children 
      and adolescents aged 7-18 years based on the total and the normal weight population 
      were provided as curves. Boys performed better than girls in FVC, SLJ, 50-m dash, 
      GS, and ER but worse in SR. The performances of FVC, SLJ, 50-m dash, GS, BMS, and ER 
      increased with age, but the estimates of SR were at the bottom among boys aged 12 
      years and girls aged 11 years. The annual increments of all components were larger 
      in boys than girls at the peak time, which was earlier in girls than boys. The gap 
      of physical fitness components between sexes increased with age, especially during 
      puberty (since after 11 years old). Conclusion: The present study described the 
      percentile curves of seven physical fitness components among the Chinese Han 
      children and adolescents based on the total and the normal weight population at the 
      national level, which could help to chart the level of physical fitness across age 
      span and identify the extreme populations with either health concerns or potential 
      talents.

      whether a preconception intensive lifestyle intervention with acute weight loss is 
      superior to a weight neutral intervention at achieving a healthy live birth. METHODS 
      AND FINDINGS: In this open-label, randomized controlled study (FIT-PLESE), 379 women 
      with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) and unexplained infertility were randomly assigned in 
      a 1:1 ratio to 2 preconception lifestyle modification groups lasting 16 weeks, 
      between July 2015 and July 2018 (final follow-up September 2019) followed by 
      infertility therapy. The primary outcome was the healthy live birth (term infant of 
      normal weight without major anomalies) incidence. This was conducted at 9 academic 
      health centers across the United States. The intensive group underwent increased 
      physical activity and weight loss (target 7%) through meal replacements and 
      medication (Orlistat) compared to a standard group with increased physical activity 
      alone without weight loss. This was followed by standardized empiric infertility 
      treatment consisting of 3 cycles of ovarian stimulation/intrauterine insemination. 
      Outcomes of any resulting pregnancy were tracked. Among 191 women randomized to 
      standard lifestyle group, 40 dropped out of the study before conception; among 188 
      women randomized to intensive lifestyle group, 31 dropped out of the study before 
      conception. All the randomized women were included in the intent-to-treat analysis 
      for primary outcome of a healthy live birth. There were no significant differences 
      in the incidence of healthy live births [standard 29/191(15.2%), intensive 
      23/188(12.2%), rate ratio 0.81 (0.48 to 1.34), P = 0.40]. Intensive had significant 
      weight loss compared to standard (-6.6 ± 5.4% versus -0.3 ± 3.2%, P < 0.001). There 
      were improvements in metabolic health, including a marked decrease in incidence of 
      the metabolic syndrome (baseline to 16 weeks: standard: 53.6% to 49.4%, intensive 
      52.8% to 32.2%, P = 0.003). Gastrointestinal side effects were significantly more 
      common in intensive. There was a higher, but nonsignificant, first trimester 
      pregnancy loss in the intensive group (33.3% versus 23.7% in standard, 95% rate 
      ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79 to 2.50). The main limitations of the 
      study are the limited power of the study to detect rare complications and the design 
      difficulty in finding an adequate time matched control intervention, as the standard 
      exercise intervention may have potentially been helpful or harmful. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      preconception intensive lifestyle intervention for weight loss did not improve 
      fertility or birth outcomes compared to an exercise intervention without targeted 
      weight loss. Improvement in metabolic health may not translate into improved female 
      fecundity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02432209.

PG  - 1-41
LID - 10.2519/jospt.2022.10731 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of implementing interventions to improve 
      guideline-recommended imaging referrals in low back pain. DESIGN: Systematic review 
      with meta-analysis. LITERATURE SEARCH: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of 
      Science Core Collection and CENTRAL from inception until June 14, 2021, Google 
      Scholar, and reference lists of relevant systematic reviews published in the last 10 
      years. We conducted forward and backwards citation tracking. STUDY SELECTION 
      CRITERIA: Randomised controlled/clinical trials in adults with low back pain to 
      improve imaging referrals. DATA SYNTHESIS: Bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk 
      of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool. Data were synthesised using narrative synthesis and random 
      effects meta-analysis (Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method). We assessed the 
      certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development 
      and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS: Of 2719 identified records, eight trials 
      were included, with six studies eligible for meta-analysis (participants: N=170460). 
      All trials incorporated clinician education; four included audit/feedback 
      components. Comparators were no-intervention control and passive dissemination of 
      guidelines. Five trials were rated as low risk of bias and two as having some 
      concerns. There was low-certainty evidence of no effect of implementing 
      interventions to improve guideline-recommended imaging referrals (odds ratio [95% 
      CI]: 0.87 [0.72, 1.05], I(2)=0%; studies: n=6). The main finding was robust to 
      sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: We found low-certainty evidence that interventions 
      to reduce imaging referral or use in low back pain had no effect. Education 
      interventions are unlikely to be effective. Organisational and policy level 
      interventions are more likely to be effective. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther, Epub 5 Feb

TI  - Enough time for lunch? The duration and governance of lunch eating times in 
      Australian primary schools: A mixed-methods study.

AB  - Developing healthy eating behaviours is important to assist children in maintaining 
      good health and decrease the risk of chronic health conditions. Recent nutrition 
      promotion efforts in Australian primary schools have mainly focused on canteen 
      guideline compliance and obesity prevention interventions. The aim of this study was 
      to investigate the primary school food environment, specifically, allocated lunch 
      eating duration and the governance of children's lunch breaks. Parents (n = 402) and 
      teachers (n = 123) were asked via an online survey, about school allocated lunch 
      eating duration and its adequacy. Respondents were asked about the supervision, 
      monitoring and feedback of children's lunches, as well as how they felt about these 
      practices. Parents (n = 308) and teachers (n = 102) also responded to the open-ended 
      question "What could be done to improve the school food environment at your 
      school?". Ten minutes was the allocated lunch eating duration reported by most 
      parents and teachers and 58% of those parents and 30% of those teachers rated this 
      as inadequate. Increasing the allocated lunch eating duration was frequently cited 
      as a way to improve the school food environment. A similar proportion of parents and 
      teachers agreed with teachers monitoring food intake, not providing feedback on food 
      brought to school, and that parents should decide what children eat. More parents 
      (44%) than teachers (23%) believed that teachers should eat their own lunch with the 
      children. These findings provide an insight into the primary school lunch 
      environment and the views of two key stakeholder groups. School food policies should 
      consider these findings in future revisions, particularly with regards to eating 
      times.

TI  - The Navajo Nation Healthy Diné Nation Act: A Description of Community Wellness 
      Projects Funded by a 2% Tax on Minimal-to-No-Nutritious-Value Foods.
PG  - E471-E479
LID - 10.1097/PHH.0000000000001371 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: To promote the health of the Navajo people, the Navajo Nation passed the 
      Healthy Diné Nation Act (HDNA) in 2014. The HDNA included a 2% tax on 
      "minimal-to-no-nutritional-value" foods and waived 5% sales tax on healthy foods, 
      the first such policy in the United States and any sovereign Tribal nation. Uniquely 
      aligned with Tribal government structures, revenue was directly allocated to 110 
      small local government entities (Chapters) for self-determined wellness projects. 
      OBJECTIVE: To characterize HDNA-funded wellness projects, test for variation in 
      project type, and funding amount over time by region and community size. DESIGN: 
      Longitudinal study assessing funded wellness projects from tax inception through 
      2019. SETTING: The Navajo Nation. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred ten Navajo Nation 
      Chapters receiving funding for self-determined wellness projects. OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      The categories and specific types of wellness projects and funding over 4 years by 
      region and community size. RESULTS: Of revenue collected in 2015-2018, more than 
      99.1% was disbursed through 2019 ($4.6 million, $13 385 annually per community) 
      across 1315 wellness projects (12 per community). The built recreational environment 
      category received 38.6% of funds, equipment/supplies 16.5%, instruction 15.7%, food 
      and water initiatives 14.0%, and social events 10.2%. Most common specific projects 
      were walking trails ($648 470), exercise equipment ($585 675), food for events ($288 
      879), playgrounds ($287 471), and greenhouses ($275 554). Only the proportion 
      allocated to instruction changed significantly over time (increased 2% annually, P = 
      .02). Smaller communities (population <1000) allocated significantly higher 
      proportions to traditional, agricultural, and intergenerational projects and less to 
      the built environment. CONCLUSIONS: Through 2019, more than 99% of HDNA revenue was 
      successfully disbursed to 110 rural, Tribal communities. Communities chose projects 
      related to promoting the built recreational environment, agriculture, and 
      fitness/nutrition education, with smaller communities emphasizing cultural and 
      intergenerational projects. These findings can inform other indigenous nations 
      considering similar policies and funding distributions.

TI  - Civilians Have Higher Adherence and More Improvements in Health with a Mediterranean 
      Diet and Circuit Training Program Compared to Firefighters.
LID - 10.1097/JOM.0000000000002478 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between diet adherence and CVD risk-reduction 
      between civilians and firefighters with a 6-week Mediterranean diet and tactical 
      training intervention. METHODS: Forty firefighters and thirty civilians 
      participated. Blood pressure, body composition, lipid levels, vascular measures and 
      aerobic capacity were measured pre- and post-intervention. Diet was self-report 
      based on number of servings consumed. Weekly diet-scores were calculated. RESULTS: 
      Both groups had improvements in blood pressure and body composition. Civilians had 
      improved lipid levels, higher overall adherence, a relationship between total 
      Med-diet score and cholesterol(R = 0.68), and higher servings consumed in foods 
      typical of Mediterranean-dietary pattern.(p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This is the first 
      exercise and diet intervention comparing firefighters to civilians. Adherence to a 
      Mediterranean-dietary pattern coupled with exercise is effective at improving 
      cardiac health. These findings substantiate the need for wellness interventions in 
      firefighters.

TI  - A thematic cluster analysis of parents' online discussions about fussy eating.
PG  - e13316
LID - 10.1111/mcn.13316 [doi]
AB  - Food fussiness is associated with non-responsive parent feeding practices, such as 
      persuasive and instrumental feeding. Although most children described as 'fussy 
      eaters' are likely exhibiting developmentally typical behaviours, up to half of the 
      parents of children 2-5 years old express concerns. Concern for fussy eating may 
      mediate the use of non-responsive feeding practices and so must be addressed in 
      parent feeding interventions. Therefore, it is critical to better understand 
      parents' concerns and how they may relate to feeding practices. This study aimed to 
      explore how parents' feeding practices and the social cognitive factors that may 
      drive them clustered based on parents' concern for fussy eating. Data were collected 
      from parent discussions of fussy eating on a Reddit forum (80,366 posts). Latent 
      Dirichlet allocation was used to identify discussions of fussy eating. Relevant 
      posts (1542) made by users who identified as a parent of a fussy eater (n = 630) 
      underwent qualitative coding and thematic analysis. Five clusters of parents were 
      identified, ranging in size from 53 to 189 users. These were primarily characterised 
      by parents' degree of concern and feeding practices: (1) High concern, 
      nonresponsive; (2) Concerned, nonresponsive; (3) Low concern, responsive; (4) Low 
      concern, mixed strategies; (5) Low concern, indulgent. Parents who used responsive 
      practices tended to be less concerned for fussy eating, have greater trust in their 
      child's ability to self-regulate hunger, have longer-term feeding goals, and exhibit 
      greater ability for personal self-regulation. Future research should further examine 
      how these constructs may be leveraged in parent feeding interventions.

TI  - Study protocol: prevalence of low energy availability and its relation to health and 
      performance among female football players.
PG  - e001219
LID - 10.1136/bmjsem-2021-001219 [doi]
LID - e001219
AB  - Enduring low energy availability (LEA) is associated with several potentially 
      serious physiological and mental conditions. LEA has been found highly prevalent 
      among female elite athletes within endurance sports, thus hampering athletes' health 
      and performance. The prevalence and the underpinning risk factors of LEA among 
      female elite football players are less studied. One reason is that the existing 
      self-report measures and technological devices to monitor energy intake and 
      expenditure are inadequately adapted to capture the nature of the physical activity 
      and energy expenditure among football players and are thus inaccurate. The present 
      paper outlines a study protocol addressing the prevalence of LEA, the measurement of 
      LEA and the correlations of LEA in terms of health and performance in female 
      football players. Four studies will be conducted with the following aims (1) to 
      evaluate the accuracy of global positioning systems (GPS)-based devices to monitor 
      energy expenditure with indirect calorimetry as the gold standard, (2) to assess 
      energy intake, quantify energy expenditure and investigate energy availability 
      through self-report instruments, double labelled water (DLW) and GPS monitoring 
      devices, (3) to determine the point prevalence of LEA using self-report instruments, 
      DLW, dual-X-ray-absorptiometry (DXA) to quantify muscle and bone mass distribution 
      and density, and a battery of hormonal analyses, and (4) to explore whether the 
      prevalence of LEA varies across a full football season. Measures covering mental 
      symptoms and psychological resources will be included, and a selection of biological 
      measures derived from study 3. Measurements of DXA and DLW are resource-demanding 
      and will be collected from one professional club (N~20 women). In contrast, the 
      remaining data will be collected from four professional clubs (N~60 women) located 
      in Bergen, the largest city within the Western region of Norway. Overall procedures 
      and biobank storage procedures have been approved for data collection that will end 
      in December 2024.

PG  - 734292

LID - 734292
AB  - Children with cystic fibrosis (CF) (cwCF) suffer from inadequate weight gain, 
      failure to thrive, and muscle weakness. The latter may be secondary to disuse 
      atrophy (muscle wasting or reduction in muscle size associated with reduced physical 
      activity and inflammation). Handgrip strength (HGS) is a reliable surrogate for 
      muscle strength and lean body mass. Data from our CF center have shown an 
      association between low HGS and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) in cwCF. 
      High-intensity interval training (HIIT) improves physical strength. Therefore, we 
      devised a project to assess implementing a HIIT exercise program in the home 
      setting, in order to improve physical strength in cwCF with HGS ≤ 50th percentile. 
      Patients were instructed to complete 3-5 sessions of HIIT exercises per week. 
      Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests were used to compare HGS, FEV(1), and body 
      mass index (BMI) percentile at baseline and at a follow-up clinic visit. Follow-up 
      was limited due to the COVID pandemic. Adherence to the HIIT regimen was poor. A 
      total of twenty-nine cwCF participated in the program. However, a total of 13 
      individuals reported some form of moderate activity at follow-up and therefore 
      constituted our final study population. There was a statistically significant 
      increase in absolute grip strength (AGS) and FEV(1) for these individuals. Even 
      though the home HIIT protocol was not followed, the project demonstrated that 
      moderate physical activity in cwCF can lead to significant improvement in HGS and 
      overall physical strength.

TI  - Assessment of Peak Oxygen Uptake with a Smartwatch and its Usefulness for Training 
      of Runners.
LID - 10.1055/a-1686-9068 [doi]
AB  - Peak oxygen uptake (˙VO(2peak)) is an important factor contributing to running 
      performance. Wearable technology may allow the assessment of ˙VO(2peak) more 
      frequently and on a larger scale. We aim to i) validate the ˙VO(2peak) assessed by a 
      smartwatch (Garmin Forerunner 245), and ii) discuss how this parameter may assist to 
      evaluate and guide training procedures. A total of 23 runners (12 female, 11 male; 
      ˙VO(2peak): 48.6±6.8 ml∙min(-1)∙kg(-1)) visited the laboratory twice to determine 
      their ˙VO(2peak) during a treadmill ramp test. Between laboratory visits, 
      participants wore a smartwatch and performed three outdoor runs to obtain ˙VO(2peak) 
      values provided by the smartwatch. The ˙VO(2peak) obtained by the criterion measure 
      ranged from 38 to 61 ml∙min(-1)∙kg(-1). The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) 
      between the smartwatch and the criterion ˙VO(2peak) was 5.7%. The criterion measure 
      revealed a coefficient of variation of 4.0% over the VO2peak range from 
      38-61 ml∙min(-1)∙kg(-1). MAPE between the smartwatch and criterion measure was 7.1, 
      4.1 and -6.2% when analyzing ˙VO(2peak) ranging from 39-45 ml∙min(-1)∙kg(-1), 
      45-55 ml∙min(-1)∙kg(-1) or 55-61 ml∙min(-1)∙kg(-1), respectively.

TI  - Turmeric root extract supplementation improves pre-frontal cortex oxygenation and 
      blood volume in older males and females: a randomised cross-over, placebo-controlled 
      study.

AB  - Ageing is associated with endothelial dysfunction and reduced cerebral blood flow 
      and oxygenation. The present study aimed to investigate whether turmeric 
      supplementation could improve cerebral oxygenation and blood volume during brain 
      activation via dynamic handgrip exercise in older males and females. Twelve older 
      males and females were studied using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over 
      design. Participants ingested turmeric root extract or placebo. Heart rate and blood 
      pressure were measured before and 2 hours after supplementation. Afterward, the 
      exercise protocol was started, and cerebral oxygenation and blood volume were 
      evaluated. During exercise, changes in cerebral oxygenation were higher after 
      turmeric extract supplementation, as was blood volume compared to placebo. Changes 
      in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure were not 
      significant. The current findings indicate the potential for curcumin as an 
      intervention for improving cerebral oxygenation and blood volume changes in older 
      males and females. Clinical trial registry: NCT04119752.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of repeated work bouts in the heat on peak 
      body core temperature and to explore sex-based differences in body core temperature 
      responses. METHODS: Fourteen males and fifteen females performed four work bouts 
      (two heavy and two moderate, alternating) in 32.5 °C Wet Bulb Globe Temperature 
      (WBGT), each separated by 30-min seated rest in 28.0 °C WBGT. Participants wore a 
      military combat uniform with body armour and helmet (10 kg load) during the work 
      bouts, removing the vest and helmet during recovery periods. RESULTS: Body core 
      temperature elevation over time was faster in the first compared with subsequent 
      work bouts of each intensity. Body core temperature elevation was similar between 
      males and females during the first heavy work bout, then remained significantly 
      lower in females for the reminder of the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the assumed 
      progressive elevation in strain, but in agreement with recent literature, a gradual 
      reduction in heat storage in subsequent exercise bouts prevented a cumulative 
      increase in heat strain in the conditions tested.

TI  - Moderate and Higher Protein Intakes Promote Superior Body Recomposition in Older 
      Women Performing Resistance Training.
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000002855 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Resistance training combined with appropriate dietary intake can promote a 
      concomitant increase in skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and reduction in fat mass, a 
      condition termed body recomposition. This study's primary purpose was to explore the 
      effects of protein ingestion on body recomposition following 24 weeks of resistance 
      training (RT) in older women. METHODS: Data from 130 untrained older women (68.7 ± 
      5.6 years, 66.5 ± 11.5 kg, 155.5 ± 6.0 cm, and 27.4 ± 4.0 kg.m-2) across six studies 
      were retrospectively analyzed. The participants were divided into tertiles according 
      to their customary protein intake (g/kg/d): lower (LP, n = 45), moderate (MP, n = 
      42), and higher (HP, n = 43) protein intake. Participants performed a whole-body RT 
      program carried out over 24 weeks (eight exercises, three sets, 8-15 repetitions, 
      three sessions a week). SMM and fat mass were determined by dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry. RESULTS: All groups increased SMM from baseline (P < 0.05), with the 
      HP and MP groups showing greater increases than the LP group (LP = 2.3%, MP = 5.4%, 
      and HP = 5.1%; P < 0.05). Reductions in fat mass were similar for all three groups 
      (LP = 1.7%, MP = 3.7%, and HP = 3.1%; P > 0.05). The composite Z-score of the 
      percentage changes from pre- to post-training indicated greater positive body 
      recomposition values for HP and MP compared to LP (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Results 
      suggest that protein intake is a moderating variable for body recomposition in older 
      women undergoing RT, with a low protein intake having a less favorable effect on 
      body recomposition.

TI  - ABBaH teens: Activity Breaks for Brain Health in adolescents: study protocol for a 
      randomized crossover trial.
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1186/s13063-021-05972-5 [doi]
LID - 22
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical activity breaks are widely being implemented in school settings 
      as a solution to increase academic performance and reduce sitting time. However, the 
      underlying physiological mechanisms suggested to improve cognitive function from 
      physical activity and the frequency, intensity, and duration of the breaks remain 
      unknown. This study will investigate the effects of frequent, short physical 
      activity breaks during prolonged sitting on task-related prefrontal cerebral blood 
      flow, cognitive performance, and psychological factors. Additionally, the moderating 
      and mediating effects of arterial stiffness on changes in cerebral blood flow will 
      be tested. METHODS: This is a protocol for a randomized crossover study that will 
      recruit 16 adolescents (13-14 years old). Participants will undergo three different 
      conditions in a randomized order, on three separate days, involving sitting 80 min 
      with a different type of break every 17 min for 3 min. The breaks will consist of 
      (1) seated social breaks, (2) simple resistance activities, and (3) step-up 
      activities. Before and after the 80-min conditions, prefrontal cerebral blood flow 
      changes will be measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (primary 
      outcome), while performing working memory tasks (1-, 2-, and 3-back tests). Arterial 
      stiffness (augmentation index and pulse wave velocity) and psychological factors 
      will also be assessed pre and post the 80-min interventions. DISCUSSION: Publication 
      of this protocol will help to increase rigor in science. The results will inform 
      regarding the underlying mechanisms driving the association between physical 
      activity breaks and cognitive performance. This information can be used for 
      designing effective and feasible interventions to be implemented in schools. TRIAL

TI  - Effect of the interaction between physical activity and estimated macronutrient 
      intake on HbA1c: population-based cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Healthy diet and physical activity (PA) are essential for preventing 
      type 2 diabetes, particularly, a combination of diet and PA. However, reports on 
      interaction between PA and diet, especially from large epidemiological studies, are 
      limited. We investigated the effect of interaction between PA and macronutrient 
      intake on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in the general population. RESEARCH DESIGN 
      AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 55 469 men and women without 
      diabetes who participated in the baseline survey of the Japan Multi-Institutional 
      Collaborative Cohort Study. A self-administered questionnaire ascertained PA and 
      macronutrient intake (carbohydrate, fat, and protein). Multiple linear regression 
      analyses were performed to adjust for confounding variables and examine the 
      interactions. In addition, we conducted a longitudinal study during a 5-year period 
      within a subcohort (n=6881) with accelerometer-assessed PA data. RESULTS: Overall, 
      PA had a weak inverse association (β=-0.00033, p=0.049) and carbohydrate intake had 
      a strong positive association (β=0.00393, p<0.001) with HbA1c. We observed a 
      tendency of interactions between PA and carbohydrate or fat intake, but not protein 
      intake, on HbA1c levels after adjusting for age, sex, study area, total energy 
      intake, alcohol consumption, smoking, and medication for hypertension or 
      hypercholesterolemia (P(interaction)=0.054, 0.006, and 0.156, respectively). The 
      inverse associations between PA and HbA1c level were more evident in participants 
      with high-carbohydrate (or low-fat) intake than in participants with 
      low-carbohydrate (or high-fat) intake. Although further adjustment for body mass 
      index slightly attenuated the above interactions (P(interaction)=0.098 for 
      carbohydrate and 0.068 for fat), the associations between PA and HbA1c level in 
      stratified analyses remained unchanged. Similar associations and interactions were 
      reproduced in the longitudinal study. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that 
      the effect of PA on HbA1c levels is modified by intake of macronutrient composition.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: In vitro and animal studies show antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, 
      and cardioprotective properties of mangos. The objective of this study was to 
      examine the effects of fresh mango consumption compared to an isocaloric control 
      snack on body weight, glucose, insulin, lipid profiles, liver function enzymes, 
      inflammation, and antioxidant activity in overweight and obese adults (BMI 
      ≥26 kg/m(2)). METHODS AND RESULTS: In a crossover design, 27 participants consumed 
      100 kcal/d of fresh mangos or isocaloric low-fat cookies daily for 12 weeks each, 
      separated by a four-week washout period. Blood glucose, C-reactive protein (CRP), 
      and aspartate transaminase activity significantly decreased while total antioxidant 
      capacity significantly increased following mango consumption. There were no 
      significant changes in body weight, body fat %, blood pressure, insulin, or lipid 
      profile following mango consumption. Cookie consumption significantly increased body 
      weight, insulin, CRP, and triglycerides. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that 
      relative to the control snack, mangos may improve certain risk factors associated 
      with overweight and obesity including improved glycemic control and reduced 
      inflammation. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTER: NCT03957928.

TI  - An experience with the use of WISN tool to calculate staffing in a palliative care 
      hospital in Brazil.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The article describes a healthcare staffing exercise that took place in 
      a Cancer Hospital IV, Brazil's first public palliative care unit. There are numerous 
      gaps in the literature on specialized cancer staffing. Palliative care is a therapy 
      modality that should begin with the diagnosis of a chronic disease, at which point 
      the personnel must be technically and numerically adequate, as well as 
      well-distributed, to provide coverage of the population that requires this type of 
      care. METHODS: The WISN tool was chosen after a systematic review of the use of 
      workload studies in palliative care, because it fulfills this objective. The WISN 
      method is based on a health worker's workload, was developed in the late 1990s in 
      the health sector and has been field-tested and implemented in several countries. 
      Direct observation was used as the fieldwork approach, which was carried out by 18 
      research assistants with the assistance of two supervisors. They monitored 60 
      professionals in seven categories for 2 weeks on weekdays in the morning and 
      afternoon periods: nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy, medical, nutrition, 
      psychology, and social services. RESULTS: Except for the medical staff, which at the 
      time included additional physicians on loan from a partner institution to address a 
      shortage in this professional group, all categories exhibited overload with WISN 
      ratios ranging from 0.53 to 0.97. The analysis of time spent on individual 
      activities indicated flaws with the services' informal organizations. The authors 
      also noticed a strong emphasis on support activities and a lack of a clear schedule 
      for training and research. The study's findings included a definition of standard 
      activities for each professional group, an analysis and comparison of activities by 
      categories, departments, and work shifts, a standard workload for training and 
      research, and recommendations to include human resources planning as a fundamental 
      part of a national policy for palliative care. CONCLUSIONS: The WISN tool can be 
      used to plan human resources in cancer centers that provide palliative care, and it 
      provides for a variety of analyses that can be combined with other approaches in the 
      literature.

AB  - Aerobic training can improve vascular endothelial function in-vivo. The aim of this 
      study was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this improvement in isolated human 
      microvascular endothelial cells. Sedentary males, aged 57 ± 6 years completed 8 
      weeks of intense aerobic training. Resting muscle biopsies were obtained from the 
      thigh muscle and used for isolation of endothelial cells (pre n = 23, post n = 16). 
      The cells were analyzed for mitochondrial respiration, H(2)O(2) emission, 
      glycolysis, protein levels of antioxidants, NADPH oxidase, endothelial nitric oxide 
      (NO) synthase and prostacyclin synthase (PGI(2)S). In-vivo microvascular function, 
      assessed by acetylcholine infusion and arterial blood pressure were also determined. 
      Endothelial mitochondrial respiration and H(2)O(2) formation were similar before and 
      after training whereas the expression of superoxide dismutase and the expression of 
      glutathione peroxidase were 2.4-fold (p = 0.012) and 2.3-fold (p = 0.006) higher, 
      respectively, after training. In-vivo microvascular function was increased by 
      1.4-fold (p = 0.036) in parallel with a 2.1-fold increase in endothelial PGI(2)S 
      expression (p = 0.041). Endothelial cell glycolysis was reduced after training, as 
      indicated by a 65% lower basal production of lactate (p = 0.003) and a 30% lower 
      expression of phosphofructokinase (p = 0.011). Subdivision of the participants 
      according to blood pressure at base-line (n = 23), revealed a 2-fold higher 
      (p = 0.049) rate of H(2)O(2) production in endothelial cells from hypertensive 
      participants. Our data show that exercise training increases skeletal muscle 
      microvascular endothelial cell metabolism, antioxidant capacity and the capacity to 
      form prostacyclin. Moreover, elevated blood pressure is associated with increased 
      endothelial mitochondrial ROS formation.

TI  - Oxygen supplementation to limit hypoxia-induced muscle atrophy in C2C12 myotubes: 
      comparison with amino acid supplement and electrical stimulation.
PG  - 287-301
LID - 10.1007/s00441-021-03492-x [doi]
AB  - In skeletal muscle, chronic oxygen depletion induces a disturbance leading to muscle 
      atrophy. Mechanical stress (physical exercise) and nutritional supplement therapy 
      are commonly used against loss of muscle mass and undernutrition in hypoxia, while 
      oxygenation therapy is preferentially used to counteract muscle fatigue and exercise 
      intolerance. However, the impact of oxygenation on skeletal muscle cells remains 
      poorly understood, in particular on signalling pathways regulating protein balance. 
      Thus, we investigated the effects of each separated treatment (mechanical stress, 
      nutritional supplementation and oxygenation therapy) on intracellular pathways 
      involved in protein synthesis and degradation that are imbalanced in skeletal muscle 
      cells atrophy resulting from hypoxia. Myotubes under hypoxia were treated by 
      electrical stimulation, amino acids supplement or oxygenation period. Signalling 
      pathways involved in protein synthesis (PI3K-Akt-mTOR) and degradation (FoxO1 and 
      FoxO3a) were investigated, so as autophagy, ubiquitin-proteasome system and myotube 
      morphology. Electrical stimulation and oxygenation treatment resulted in higher 
      myotube diameter, myogenic fusion index and myotubes density until 48 h 
      post-treatment compared to untreated hypoxic myotubes. Both treatments also induced 
      inhibition of FoxO3a and decreased activity of ubiquitin-proteasome system; however, 
      their impact on protein synthesis pathway was specific for each one. Indeed, 
      electrical stimulation impacted upstream proteins to mTOR (i.e., Akt) while 
      oxygenation treatment activated downstream targets of mTOR (i.e., 4E-BP1 and 
      P70S6K). In contrast, amino acid supplementation had very few effects on myotube 
      morphology nor on protein homeostasis. This study demonstrated that electrical 
      stimulation or oxygenation period are two effective treatments to fight against 
      hypoxia-induced muscle atrophy, acting through different molecular adaptations.

TI  - Preliminary Assessment of the Healthy Beverage Index for US Children and

      Olds.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Improving beverage patterns of children and adolescents is recommended 
      for combatting obesity and reducing disease risk. Therefore, it is important to 
      assess beverage intake quality in this population. For adults, the Healthy Beverage 
      Index (HBI) was created to assess beverage intake quality, but a similar tool did 
      not exist for children and adolescents. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to develop an 
      HBI for US Children and Adolescents (HBI-CA), and then assess the validity and 
      reliability of this tool. DESIGN: Modeled after the adult HBI, age-specific, 
      evidence-based beverage recommendations were compiled. Ten components were included 
      to assess beverage intake quality. Validity and reliability were assessed using 
      cross-sectional data and methods similar to those used for the evaluation of the 
      Healthy Eating Index. PARTICIPANTS: The 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition 
      Examination Survey provided 24-hour dietary recall data for 2,874 children and 
      adolescents aged 2 to 19 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HBI-CA scores were the main 
      outcome measure. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: To assess validity, independent t 
      tests were used to determine differences in HBI-CA component and total scores among 
      groups, and principal component analysis was completed to examine 
      multidimensionality of the HBI-CA. Pearson bivariate correlations were used to 
      assess reliability. RESULTS: The HBI-CA produced a (mean ± standard error) total 
      score of 69.2 ± 0.8, which is similar to the adult HBI mean total score of 63. 
      Principal component analysis identified six factors, indicating the 
      multidimensionality of the HBI-CA, with more than one combination of components 
      contributing to variation in total scores. Most HBI-CA components were significantly 
      correlated to the total score, with met fluid requirements, total beverage energy, 
      sugar-sweetened beverage, and water components demonstrating the strongest 
      correlations (r range = 0.335-0.735; P ≤ 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results provide 
      preliminary evidence to support the validity and reliability of the HBI-CA. If 
      future research establishes the predictive validity and sensitivity of the HBI-CA, 
      this tool could be useful to quantify the beverage intake quality of children and 
      adolescents.

TI  - Uremic toxins levels from the gut microbiota seem not to be altered by physical 
      exercise in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 687-693

AB  - PURPOSE: Regular physical exercise may result in many benefits to patients with 
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), including gut microbiota 
      modulation and solute removal. The study aimed to evaluate the effects of two 
      programs of intradialytic exercises on uremic toxins plasma levels in HD patients. 
      METHODS: In experiment 1, twenty HD patients [12 men, 44.1 ± 8.9 years, BMI of 
      23.4 ± 2.4 kg/m(2)] were randomized into two groups: Aerobic exercise group (AEG, 
      n = 11) that performed aerobic exercise on an adapted exercise bike three times a 
      week for three months (36 sessions) and Control group (CG, n = 9). In experiment 2, 
      twenty-six HD patients [19 men, 47.6 ± 11.0 years, BMI of 25.9 ± 3.6 kg/m(2)] were 
      randomized into Resistance exercise group (REG, n = 14) that performed a resistance 
      exercise program (using elastic bands and ankle cuffs with both lower limbs) 
      monitored three times a week, during six months (72 sessions) and CG (n = 12). 
      P-cresyl sulfate (p-CS), indoxyl sulfate (IS), and indol-3-acetic acid (IAA) plasma 
      levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with 
      fluorescent detection. RESULTS: The uremic toxins plasma levels did not reduce in 
      both exercise programs, aerobic exercise (IS: 32.7 ± 14.0 vs 33.0 ± 15.4 mg/L, 
      p = 0.86; p-CS: 59.9 ± 39.3 vs 60.0 ± 41.2 mg/L, p = 0.99; IAA: 2233 [1488-2848] vs 
      2227 [1275-2824] µg/L, p = 0.72) and resistance exercise (IS: 28.3 ± 11.3 vs 
      29.1 ± 9.7 mg/L, p = 0.77; p-CS: 31.4 ± 21.3 vs 34.2 ± 19.8 mg/L, p = 0.63; IAA: 
      1628 [1330-3530] vs 2000 [971-3085] µg/L, p = 0.35) in HD patients. CONCLUSION: 
      According to our findings, physical exercise does not appear to alter the levels of 
      uremic toxins produced by the gut microbiota in HD patients.

TI  - Time-Restricted Eating: Integrating The What With The When.
LID - nmac015 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/advances/nmac015 [doi]
AB  - Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a popular dietary strategy that emphasises the 
      timing of meals in alignment with diurnal circadian rhythms, permitting ad libitum 
      energy intake during a restricted (∼8-10 h) eating window each day. Unlike 
      energy-restricted diets or intermittent fasting interventions that focus on weight 
      loss, many of the health-related benefits of TRE are independent of reductions in 
      body weight. However, TRE research to date has largely ignored what food is consumed 
      (i.e., macronutrient composition and energy density), overlooking a plethora of past 
      epidemiological and interventional dietary research. To determine some of the 
      potential mechanisms underpinning the benefits of TRE on metabolic health, future 
      studies need to increase the rigour of dietary data collected, assessed, and 
      reported to ensure a consistent and standardised approach in TRE research. This 
      perspective provides an overview of studies investigating TRE interventions in 
      humans and considers dietary intake (both what and when food is eaten) and their 
      impact on selected health outcomes (i.e., weight loss, glycaemic control). 
      Integrating existing dietary knowledge about what food is eaten with our recent 
      understanding on when food should be consumed is essential to optimise the impact of 
      dietary strategies aimed at improving metabolic health outcomes.

      obese individuals, we investigated the effects of taurine supplementation on adipose 
      tissue using transcriptome analysis, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and subcutaneous white 
      adipose tissue (scWAT) of obese women. METHODS: First, we applied bioinformatics 
      analysis to evaluate the effect of the taurine synthesis pathway on the adipose 
      tissue of several BXD mice strains. After that, using 3T3-L1 adipocytes, we 
      investigated the effects of different taurine doses in proteins related to insulin 
      signaling, lipid oxidation, and mitochondrial function. Finally, we evaluated the 
      effects of taurine supplementation (3 grams, 8 wk) on the same proteins in the scWAT 
      of obese women. RESULTS: The transcriptome analysis showed that the taurine 
      biosynthesis pathway was positively associated with insulin signaling and 
      mitochondrial metabolism in the scWAT of BXD mice. The experiments using 3T3-L1 
      cells highlighted that the taurine dosage has an essential function in taurine 
      synthesis, insulin, and mitochondrial markers. In contrast, the 8-wk taurine 
      administration did not change the basal insulin, proteins of the taurine synthesis 
      or insulin pathways, lipid oxidation, or mitochondrial metabolism in the scWAT of 
      obese women. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, to our knowledge, we showed that 
      supplementation with 3 g of taurine for 8 wk promoted no effect in the insulin 
      signaling pathway in the scWAT of obese women. These findings bring new perspectives 
      to investigate different taurine doses and the intervention period for human studies 
      owing to the potential antiobesity activity of taurine.

TI  - Variation in urine osmolality throughout pregnancy: a longitudinal, 
      randomized-control trial among women with overweight and obesity.
PG  - 127-140

AB  - PURPOSE: Water needs increase during pregnancy, and proper hydration is critical for 
      maternal and fetal health. This study characterized weekly hydration status changes 
      throughout pregnancy and examined change in response to a randomized, behavioral 
      intervention. An exploratory analysis tested how underhydration during pregnancy was 
      associated with birth outcomes. METHODS: The Healthy Mom Zone Study is a 
      longitudinal, randomized-control trial intervention aiming to regulate gestational 
      weight gain (GWG) in pregnant women with overweight/obesity (n = 27). Fourteen women 
      received standard of care; 13 women additionally received weekly guidance on 
      nutrition, physical activity, water intake, and health-promoting behaviors. 
      Hydration status was measured weekly via overnight urine osmolality (Uosm) 
      from ~ 8-36 weeks gestation; underhydration was dichotomized (Uosm ≥ 500 mOsm/kg). 
      Gestational age- and sex-standardized birth weight and length z scores and 
      percentiles were calculated. We used mixed-effect and linear regression models to 
      test covariate-adjusted relationships. RESULTS: No differences existed in Uosm or 
      other characteristics between control and intervention women at baseline. 
      Significant interactions (p = 0.01) between intervention and week of pregnancy on 
      Uosm indicated intervention women maintained lower Uosm, whereas control women had a 
      significant quadratic (inverse-U) relationship and greater Uosm in the second and 
      early third trimesters. Results were consistent across robustness and sensitivity 
      checks. Exploratory analyses suggest underhydration was associated with birth 
      weight, but not length, in opposite ways in the second vs. third trimester. 
      CONCLUSION: A multi-component behavioral intervention helped women with 
      overweight/obesity maintain better hydration throughout pregnancy. Future studies 
      should confirm birth outcome results as they have important implications for early 
      life nutrition. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03945266;

TI  - Reducing Psychological Reactance to Health Promotion Messages: Comparing Preemptive 
      and Postscript Mitigation Strategies.
PG  - 366-374
LID - 10.1080/10410236.2020.1839203 [doi]
AB  - This study compared the relative efficacy of two strategies designed to mitigate 
      psychological reactance in health campaigns by using reminders of behavioral 
      autonomy: preemptive scripts, which appear before the appeal, and restoration 
      postscripts, which appear after. Employing a mixed-model experiment with a 2 (threat 
      to freedom: low vs. high) × 3 (reactance-mitigation strategy: control vs. preemptive 
      script vs. restoration postscript) × 2 (health campaign topic: exercise vs. 
      nutrition) between-subjects design and a within-subjects factor of time (immediate 
      posttest measurement followed by a one-week delay), this study (N = 394) compared 
      the effects of the two mitigation strategies on reactance, attitude, and behavioral 
      intention at two points in time. Moderated mediation models indicated that the 
      reactance-mitigation strategies equivalently reduced the degree to which reactance 
      was experienced in response to increasingly threatening health appeals (relative to 
      the control). This effect indirectly influenced behavioral intention via attitude 
      change and remained after one week.

TI  - Isonitrogenous low-carbohydrate diet elicits specific changes in metabolic gene 
      expression in the skeletal muscle of exercise-trained mice.
PG  - e0262875
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0262875 [doi]
LID - e0262875
AB  - With the renewed interest in low-carbohydrate diets (LCDs) in the sports field, a 
      few animal studies have investigated their potential. However, most rodent studies 
      have used an LCD containing low protein, which does not recapitulate a human LCD, 
      and the muscle-specific adaptation in response to an LCD remains unclear. Therefore, 
      we investigated the effects of two types of LCDs, both containing the same 
      proportion of protein as a regular diet (isonitrogenous LCD; INLCD), on body 
      composition, exercise performance, and metabolic fuel selection at the genetic level 
      in the skeletal muscles of exercise-trained mice. Three groups of mice (n = 8 in 
      each group), one fed a regular AIN-93G diet served as the control, and the others 
      fed either of the two INLCDs containing 20% protein and 10% carbohydrate (INLCD-10%) 
      or 20% protein and 1% carbohydrate (INLCD-1%) had a regular exercise load (5 
      times/week) for 12 weeks. Body weight and muscle mass did not decrease in either of 
      the INLCD-fed groups, and the muscle glycogen levels and endurance capacity did not 
      differ among the three groups. Only in the mice fed INLCD-1% did the plasma ketone 
      concentration significantly increase, and gene expression related to glucose 
      utilization significantly declined in the muscles. Both INLCD-1% and INLCD-10% 
      consumption increased gene expression related to lipid utilization. These results 
      suggest that, although INLCD treatment did not affect endurance capacity, it helped 
      maintain muscle mass and glycogen content regardless of the glucose intake 
      restrictions in trained mice. Moreover, an INLCD containing a low carbohydrate 
      content might present an advantage by increasing lipid oxidation without ketosis and 
      suppressing muscle glucose utilization.

TI  - Folic Acid Inhibits Aging-Induced Telomere Attrition and Apoptosis in Astrocytes In 
      Vivo and In Vitro.
PG  - 286-297
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhab208 [doi]
AB  - Folic acid (FA) has been reported to inhibit astrocyte apoptosis and improve 
      aging-induced disorders; however, its role in telomere attrition remains unclear. In 
      present study, 4-month-old senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice were 
      assigned to four treatment groups for the in vivo experiment: FA-deficient diet 
      (FA-D) group, FA-normal diet (FA-N) group, low FA-supplemented diet (FA-L) group, 
      and high FA-supplemented diet (FA-H) group. These mice were euthanized when 
      10 months old. There was also a young SAMP8 (4 months old) control group (Con-Y) fed 
      with FA-normal diet. In in vitro study, primary cultures of astrocytes from 
      hippocampus and cerebral cortex were incubated for five generations with various 
      concentrations of FA (0-40 μM) and were assigned to five groups: FA 0 μM (generation 
      5), FA 10 μM (generation 5), FA 20 μM (generation 5), FA 40 μM (generation 5), and 
      FA 10 μM (generation 1). The results showed that FA supplementation inhibited 
      aging-induced astrocytosis, astrocyte apoptosis, neurodegeneration, and prevented 
      telomere attrition in hippocampus and cortex of SAMP8 mice. FA supplementation also 
      decreased apoptosis and telomere attrition, and increased telomerase activity, in 
      primary cultures of astrocytes. These results showed that it may be one of the 
      mechanisms that FA inhibiting aging-induced apoptosis of astrocyte by alleviating 
      telomere attrition.

TI  - Does adaptive thermogenesis occur after weight loss in adults? A systematic review.
PG  - 451-469
LID - 10.1017/S0007114521001094 [doi]
AB  - Adaptive thermogenesis (AT) has been proposed to be a compensatory response that may 
      resist weight loss (WL) and promote weight regain. This systematic review examined 
      the existence of AT in adults after a period of negative energy balance (EB) with or 
      without a weight stabilisation phase. Studies published until 15 May 2020 were 
      identified from PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, SCOPUS and Web of 
      Science. Inclusion criteria included statistically significant WL, observational 
      with follow-up or experimental studies, age > 18y, sample size ≥10 participants, 
      intervention period ≥ 1week, published in English, objective measures of total daily 
      energy expenditure (EE) (TDEE), resting EE (REE) and sleeping EE(SEE). The 
      systematic review was registered at PROSPERO (2020 CRD42020165348). A total of 
      thirty-three studies comprising 2528 participants were included. AT was observed in 
      twenty-seven studies. Twenty-three studies showed significant values for AT for REE 
      (82·8 %), four for TDEE (80·0 %) and two for SEE (100 %). A large heterogeneity in 
      the methods used to quantify AT and between subjects and among studies regarding the 
      magnitude of WL and/or of AT was reported. Well-designed studies reported lower or 
      non-significant values for AT. These findings suggest that although WL may lead to 
      AT in some of the EE components, these values may be small or non-statistically 
      significant when higher-quality methodological designs are used. Furthermore, AT 
      seems to be attenuated, or non-existent, after periods of weight 
      stabilisation/neutral EB. More high-quality studies are warranted not only to 
      disclose the existence of AT but also to understand its clinical implications on 
      weight management outcomes.

TI  - Association of sarcopenia and physical activity with functional outcome in older 
      Asian patients hospitalized for rehabilitation.
PG  - 391-397
LID - 10.1007/s40520-021-01934-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies reported that sarcopenia and physical inactivity 
      affected clinical outcome in older adults; however, the association with functional 
      outcome has not been studied in a rehabilitation setting. AIM: This study aimed to 
      assess the association of sarcopenia and physical activity with the functional 
      outcome in older hospitalized rehabilitation patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional 
      study was performed in older patients consecutively admitted to convalescent 
      rehabilitation wards. Sarcopenia was diagnosed based on the Asia Working Group for 
      Sarcopenia 2019 criteria, and physical activity time (light-intensity physical 
      activity, LIPA; moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, MVPA) was measured using an 
      activity monitor with a triaxial accelerometer. The association of sarcopenia and 
      physical activity with functional outcome, measured by the Functional Independence 
      Measure (FIM) motor function, was determined using multiple regression analysis 
      adjusted for age, sex, primary disease diagnosis, length of acute hospital stay, 
      Charlson comorbidity index, body mass index, and mini-nutritional assessment-short 
      form score. RESULTS: Out of 211 rehabilitation older inpatients [median 
      (interquartile range) age 78 (11) years, 150 women (71%)], 104 patients (49%) were 
      diagnosed with sarcopenia. Patients with sarcopenia had significantly lower LIPA 
      (p < 0.001) and MVPA (p = 0.002) than those without sarcopenia. In multiple 
      regression analysis, LIPA (β = 0.39, p < 0.001) and MVPA (β = 0.12, p = 0.02) were 
      associated with FIM-motor function even after they were adjusted for confounding 
      factors, including sarcopenia. CONCLUSIONS: In rehabilitation older inpatients, 
      sarcopenia and physical activity were independently associated with functional 
      outcome, and physical activity was lower in sarcopenia patients than in those 
      without sarcopenia.

TI  - Associations of quantity and quality of carbohydrate sources with subjective 
      appetite sensations during 3-year weight-loss maintenance: Results from the PREVIEW 
      intervention study.
PG  - 219-230
LID - S0261-5614(21)00549-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.clnu.2021.11.038 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The association of quantity and quality of carbohydrate sources 
      with appetite during long-term weight-loss maintenance (WLM) after intentional 
      weight loss (WL) is unclear. We aimed to investigate longitudinal associations of 
      quantity and quality of carbohydrate sources with changes in subjective appetite 
      sensations during WLM. METHODS: This secondary analysis evaluated longitudinal data 
      from the 3-year WLM phase of the PREVIEW study, a 2 × 2 factorial (diet-physical 
      activity arms), multi-center, randomized trial. 1279 individuals with overweight or 
      obesity and prediabetes (25-70 years; BMI≥25 kg m(-2)) were included. Individuals 
      were merged into 1 group to assess longitudinal associations of yearly changes in 
      appetite sensations. Quantity and quality of carbohydrate sources including total 
      carbohydrate, glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL), and total dietary fiber were 
      assessed via 4-day food diaries at 4 timepoints (26, 52, 104, and 156 weeks) during 
      WLM. Visual analog scales were used to assess appetite sensations in the previous 
      week. RESULTS: During WLM, participants consumed on average 160.6 (25th, 75th 
      percentiles 131.1, 195.8) g·day(-1) of total carbohydrate, with GI 53.8 (48.7, 58.8) 
      and GL 85.3 (67.2, 108.9) g day(-1), and 22.3 (17.6, 27.3) g·day(-1) of dietary 
      fiber. In the available-case analysis, multivariable-adjusted linear mixed models 
      with repeated measures showed that each 30-g increment in total carbohydrate was 
      associated with increases in hunger (1.36 mm year(-1), 95% CI 0.77, 1.95, 
      P < 0.001), desire to eat (1.10 mm year(-1), 0.59, 1.60, P < 0.001), desire to eat 
      something sweet (0.99 mm year(-1), 0.30, 1.68, P = 0.005), and weight regain 
      (0.20%·year(-1), 0.03, 0.36, P = 0.022). Increasing GI was associated with weight 
      regain, but not associated with increases in appetite sensations. Each 20-unit 
      increment in GL was associated with increases in hunger (0.92 mm year(-1), 0.33, 
      1.51, P = 0.002), desire to eat (1.12 mm year(-1), 0.62, 1.62, P < 0.001), desire to 
      eat something sweet (1.13 mm year(-1), 0.44, 1.81, P < 0.001), and weight regain 
      (0.35%·year(-1), 0.18, 0.52, P < 0.001). Surprisingly, dietary fiber was also 
      associated with increases in desire to eat, after adjustment for carbohydrate or GL. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In participants with moderate carbohydrate and dietary fiber intake, 
      and low to moderate GI, we found that higher total carbohydrate, GL, and total 
      fiber, but not GI, were associated with increases in subjective desire to eat or 
      hunger over 3 years. This study was registered as ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01777893.

TI  - The impact of a 6-week community-based physical activity and health education 
      intervention-a pilot study among Irish farmers.
PG  - 433-445
LID - 10.1007/s11845-021-02579-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a higher prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases among Irish 
      farmers than the general adult population. Lifestyle interventions that increase 
      physical activity and improve dietary patterns have been associated with reduced 
      chronic disease risk and improved quality of life among high-risk populations. The 
      impact of lifestyle interventions among Irish farmers is unknown. AIM: To assess the 
      effectiveness of a community-based intervention on farmer health, cardiovascular 
      fitness, lower limb strength endurance, and dietary intake. METHODS: A 6-week 
      physical activity and lifestyle education intervention involving two 60-min 
      circuit-based exercise training sessions and one 60-min health education workshop 
      per week was implemented. Pre- and post-measurements included total body weight, 
      body fat percentage, lean muscle mass, resting blood pressure, fasting blood 
      glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, cardiovascular fitness, lower limb strength, 
      perceived physical and mental health, and dietary intake. RESULTS: Thirty farmers 
      completed the intervention giving an adherence rate of 75%. At baseline, mean BMI 
      (32.7 ± 4.1 kg/m(2)), body fat percent (31.7 ± 6.7), waist circumference (110.2 ± 
      10.4 cm), systolic (128.7 ± 7.8 mmHg) and diastolic (86.2 ± 6.8 mmHg) blood pressure 
      were higher than recommended levels. Significant improvements (p < 0.05) were found 
      for total body weight, BMI, waist and hip circumferences, cardiovascular fitness, 
      lower limb strength endurance, systolic blood pressure, total energy, total fat, 
      total unsaturated fat, monounsaturated fat, saturated fat, trans fat, total 
      carbohydrate, sodium, cholesterol and percentage energy intakes of total fat, 
      saturated fat, protein, and physical and mental health scores. CONCLUSIONS: Irish 
      farmers remain at high risk of developing chronic diseases but respond positively to 
      lifestyle intervention.

AB  - In the current scenario, in which an elevated number of COVID-19 survivors present 
      with severe physical deconditioning, exercise intolerance, persistent symptoms, and 
      other post-acute consequences, effective rehabilitation strategies are of utmost 
      relevance. In this study, we report for the first time the effect of home-based 
      exercise training (HBET) in a survivor patient from critical COVID-19 illness. A 
      67-year-old woman who had critical COVID-19 disease [71 days of hospitalization, of 
      which 49 days were in the intensive care unit (ICU) with invasive mechanical 
      ventilation due to respiratory failure] underwent a 10-week HBET aiming to 
      recovering overall physical condition. Before and after the intervention, we 
      assessed cardiopulmonary parameters, skeletal muscle strength and functionality, 
      fatigue severity, and self-reported persistent symptoms. At baseline (3 months after 
      discharge), she presented with severe impairment in cardiorespiratory functional 
      capacity (<50% age predicted VO(2peak)). After the intervention, remarkable 
      improvements in VO(2peak) (from 10.61 to 15.48 mL·kg(-1)·min(-1), Δ: 45.9%), oxygen 
      uptake efficiency slope (OUES; from 1.0 to 1.3 L·min(-1), Δ: 30.1%), HR/VO(2) slope 
      (from 92 to 52 bpm·L(-1), Δ: -43.5%), the lowest VE/VCO(2) ratio (from 35.4 to 32.9 
      L·min(-1), Δ: -7.1%), and exertional dyspnea were observed. In addition, handgrip 
      strength (from 22 to 27 kg, Δ: 22.7%), 30-s Sit-to-Stand (30-STS; from 14 to 16 
      repetitions, Δ:14.3%), Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG; from 8.25 to 7.01 s, Δ: -15%) 
      performance and post-COVID functional status (PCFS) score (from 4 to 2) were also 
      improved from baseline to post-intervention. Self-reported persistent symptoms were 
      also improved, and Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score decreased (from 4 to 2.7) from 
      baseline to post-intervention. This is the first evidence that a semi-supervised, 
      HBET program may be safe and potentially effective in improving cardiorespiratory 
      and physical functionality in COVID-19 survivors. Controlled studies are warranted 
      to confirm these findings.

TI  - A comparison of accelerometer cut-points for measuring physical activity and 
      sedentary time in adolescents with Down syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No cut-points have been developed for youth with Down syndrome; there is 
      concern that altered gait patterns, decreased energy expenditure and exercise 
      capacity of individuals with Down syndrome may produce inaccurate physical activity 
      data if accelerometer data are analyzed using cut-points from populations with 
      typical development and other IDD diagnoses. AIM: To compare physical activity and 
      sedentary time across existing accelerometer cut-point methods in adolescents with 
      Down syndrome. METHODS: In this cross-sectional analysis, participants diagnosed 
      with Down syndrome (n = 37; 15.5 ± 1.9 years; 57 % female) wore an accelerometer on 
      their non-dominant hip for seven-days. Data were analyzed and compared across four 
      physical activity intensity cut-points: Evenson, Freedson 4-MET, McGarty, and 
      Romanizi. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: Differences in time spent in each intensity across 
      cut-point methods were evident for sedentary (448-615 min/day), light (72-303 
      min/day) and moderate-to-vigorous (12-77 min/day) activities. Between 0.0-67.6 % of 
      the sample met the physical activity guidelines, depending on the cut-point method 
      selected. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: This study presents the wide variation of 
      accumulated physical activity minutes when different cut-points are applied to 
      individuals with Down syndrome. There is a critical need to establish Down 
      syndrome-specific measures of physical activity assessment rather than applying 
      methods developed for their peers with typical development. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: 
      This paper highlights concerns over the application of objective measurements of 
      physical activity in youth with Down syndrome from measurement methods derived from 
      populations with typical development. This is the first manuscript to examine this 
      issue in a sample comprised solely of youth with Down syndrome. Results demonstrate 
      the large variation in time spent in each activity intensity that arise due to the 
      application of different cut-point methods.

AB  - Maternal hypercholesterolemia (MHC), a pathological condition characterized by an 
      exaggerated rise in maternal serum cholesterol during pregnancy, may influence 
      offspring hepatic lipid metabolism and increase the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver 
      disease (NAFLD). As NAFLD is characterized by a sexual dimorphic response, we 
      assessed whether early-life exposure to excessive cholesterol influences the 
      development of NAFLD in offspring and whether this occurs in a sex-specific manner. 
      Female apoE(-/-) mice were randomly assigned to a control (CON) or a high 
      cholesterol (CH; 0.15%) diet prior to breeding. At parturition, a cross-fostering 
      approach was used to establish three groups: (1) normal cholesterol exposure 
      throughout gestation and lactation (CON-CON); (2) excessive cholesterol exposure 
      throughout gestation and lactation (CH-CH); and (3) excessive cholesterol exposure 
      in the gestation period only (CH-CON). Adult male offspring (PND 84) exposed to 
      excessive cholesterol during gestation only (CH-CON) demonstrated hepatic 
      triglyceride (TG) accumulation and reduced lipogenic gene expression. However, male 
      mice with a prolonged cholesterol exposure throughout gestation and lactation 
      (CH-CH) had a similar, but not exacerbated hepatic response. Further, with the 
      exception of higher serum TG in adult CH-CH females, evidence for a programming 
      effect in female offspring was largely absent in comparison with males. These 
      results indicate a sexual dimorphic response with respect to the effect of MHC on 
      later life hepatic steatosis and highlight the gestation period as the most 
      influential malprogramming window for hepatic lipid dysfunction in males.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore a protection motivation theory screening tool for predicting 
      rehabilitation adherence. DESIGN: Analysis of a randomised controlled trial. 
      SETTING: An exercise physiology and physiotherapist clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Patients 
      with chronic low back pain (n=40). INTERVENTIONS: General strength and conditioning 
      (GSC) compared with motor control and manual therapy. Primary and secondary outcome 
      measures: predicting patient adherence to supervised sessions and dropout using the 
      Sports Injury Rehabilitation Beliefs Scale, seven-item barriers checklist and 
      Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and Sports Injury Rehabilitation Adherence 
      Scale. RESULTS: Average attendance was 77% (motor control and manual therapy) and 
      60% (GSC) with eight dropouts. No Sports Injury Rehabilitation Adherence Scale 
      values other than 5 across all three components were recorded. Treatment efficacy 
      (p=0.019), self-efficacy (p=0.001), rehabilitation value (p=0.028) and injury 
      severity (p=0.002) positively correlated with susceptibility (the extent of 
      vulnerability to having health problems from not taking action). Rehabilitation 
      value positively correlated with self-efficacy (p=0.005). Injury severity positively 
      correlated with rehabilitation value (p=0.011). The final model for number of 
      cancellations included rehabilitation value only and accounted for approximately 12% 
      of variance (p=0.033). CONCLUSIONS: Perceived value of rehabilitation should be 
      considered by clinicians in the rehabilitation setting to improve treatment 
      adherence in patients with chronic low back pain. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

TI  - Power attenuation from restricting range of motion is minimized in subjects with 
      fast RTD and following isometric training.
PG  - 497-510

AB  - Time-dependent measures consisting of rate of torque development (RTD), rate of 
      velocity development (RVD), and rate of neuromuscular activation can be used to 
      evaluate explosive muscular performance, which becomes critical when performing 
      movements throughout limited ranges of motion (ROM). In this study, we investigated 
      how restricting ROM influences power production while also exploring the 
      relationship with time-dependent measures before and after isometric resistance 
      training. Using a HUMAC NORM dynamometer, seven males (27 ± 7 yr) and six females 
      (22 ± 3 yr) underwent 8 wk of maximal isometric dorsiflexion training 3 days/wk. One 
      leg was trained at 0° [short-muscle tendon unit (MTU) length] and the other at 40° 
      of plantar flexion (long-MTU length). RTD and rate of neuromuscular activation were 
      evaluated during "fast" maximal isometric contractions. Power, RVD, and rate of 
      neuromuscular activation were assessed during maximal isotonic contractions in four 
      conditions [small (40°-30° of plantar flexion) ROM at 10% and 50% MVC; large (40°-0° 
      of plantar flexion) ROM at 10% and 50% MVC] for both legs, pre- and posttraining. 
      Despite no change in rate of neuromuscular activation following training, peak 
      power, RTD, and RVD increased at both MTU lengths (P < 0.05). Strong relationships 
      (R(2) = 0.73) were observed between RTD and peak power in the small ROM, indicating 
      that fast time-dependent measures are critical for optimal performance when ROM is 
      constrained. Meanwhile, strong relationships (R(2) = 0.90) between RVD and power 
      were observed at the 50% load, indicating that RVD is critical when limited by load 
      and ROM is not confined. Maximal isometric dorsiflexion training can be used to 
      improve time-dependent measures (RTD, RVD) to minimize power attenuation when ROM is 
      restricted.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Power output was greater in the unrestricted than 
      restricted ROM, and there were strong relationships between rate of torque 
      development (RTD) and velocity development (RVD) with peak power. RTD and RVD had 
      the strongest relationships with power when ROM was restricted and unrestricted, 
      respectively. Following 8 wk of isometric training, discrepancies in power between 
      restricted and unrestricted ROM were reduced. Increasing RTD through isometric 
      training increased power in dynamic movements, especially when ROM was restricted.

TI  - Physically inactive adults are the main users of sports dietary supplements in the 
      capital of Brazil.
LID - 10.1007/s00394-022-02799-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This cross-sectional study aimed to provide estimates of dietary 
      supplements (DS) use and to examine the relationship between sports dietary 
      supplements (SDS) use and sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristic, body mass 
      index and total daily physical activity (PA) in the adult population of Brasília, 
      Brazil. METHODS: DS use was collected from 506 adults via a Food Frequency 
      Questionnaire. DS were divided into multivitamin-minerals, electrolyte drinks, 
      energy, protein, partial meal replacements, creatine, caffeine, and others. 
      Electrolyte drinks, energy, and protein supplements were considered as SDS. PA was 
      estimated from a 24-h PA recall, and total MET (metabolic equivalents)/day and 
      MET-h/day were calculated. Participants were categorized as physically inactive or 
      active according to MET-h/day. RESULTS: DS were used by 68% of adults; 
      multivitamin-minerals (38%) and protein supplements (29%) were the most commonly 
      used products. SDS use was associated with the highest socioeconomic level, younger 
      age, and male gender, but not with PA. Also, most SDS users were physically 
      inactive. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that SDS may be used unnecessarily by 
      adults in Brasília. Specific recommendations and control procedures for the use of 
      SDS are warranted.

TI  - The association between preoperative body composition and aerobic fitness in 
      patients scheduled for colorectal surgery.
PG  - 93-101
LID - 10.1111/codi.15941 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Although cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is considered the gold 
      standard, a preoperative abdominal CT scan might also provide information concerning 
      preoperative aerobic fitness for risk assessment. This study aimed to investigate 
      the association between preoperative CT-scan-derived body composition variables and 
      preoperative CPET variables of aerobic fitness in colorectal surgery. METHOD: In 
      this retrospective cohort study, CT images at level L3 were analysed for skeletal 
      muscle mass, skeletal muscle radiation attenuation, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) 
      mass and subcutaneous adipose tissue mass. Regression analyses were performed to 
      investigate the relation between CT-scan-derived body composition variables, 
      CPET-derived aerobic fitness and other preoperative patient-related variables. 
      Logistic regression analysis was performed to predict a preoperative anaerobic 
      threshold (AT) ≤ 11.1 ml/kg/min as cut-off for having a high risk for postoperative 
      complications. RESULTS: Data from 78 patients (45 men; mean [SD] age 74.5 
      [6.4 years]) were analysed. A correlation coefficient of 0.55 was observed between 
      absolute AT and skeletal muscle mass index. Absolute AT (R(2) of 51.1%) was lower in 
      patients with a lower skeletal muscle mass index, together with higher age, lower 
      body mass and higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score. Higher ASA 
      score (odds ratio 5.64; P = 0.033) and higher VAT mass (odds ratio 1.02; P = 0.036) 
      were associated with an increased risk of an AT ≤ 11.1 ml/kg/min. CONCLUSION: Body 
      composition variables from the preoperative CT scan were moderately associated with 
      preoperative CPET-derived aerobic fitness. Higher ASA score and higher VAT mass were 
      associated with an increased risk of an AT ≤ 11.1 ml/kg/min.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the potential interaction between genetic background and 
      adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, macronutrient intake and physical activity with 
      regard to obesity in a sample of healthy adults. DESIGN: Cross-sectional 
      epidemiological study including 392 adults living in the Mediterranean basin. Data 
      including FFQ, IPAQ and sociodemographic questionnaires were collected via 
      face-to-face interviews. Anthropometric measures were performed and saliva swab for 
      DNA extraction. Two MD scores were calculated to assess the adherence of the 
      population to this pattern. Three single nucleotid polymorphisms (SNPs) related to 
      obesity were studied: FTO, MC4R, MTHFR. FINDINGS: FTO rs9939609 is significantly 
      associated with WHR, and MC4R with all phenotypic traits linked to obesity (BMI, WC 
      and WHR). However, MTHFR polymorphism didn't show any significant correlation with 
      anthropometric parameters. Adherence to the MD and high level of physical activity 
      do not seem to protect against the occurrence of overweight and obesity in 
      genetically predisposed subjects. CONCLUSION: Classic lifestyle interventions are 
      insufficient in addressing the challenging obesity pandemic. Identifying more 
      genetic variants and understanding their interaction with lifestyle will improve the 
      clinical outcome of these variants for risk prediction and personalized nutrition 
      and medical therapy. Also, the MD should undergo a redefinition adapted to each 
      country on the Mediterranean basin in order to organize public health measures for 
      its comeback.

TI  - Comparison of high intensity interval training with standard cardiac rehabilitation 
      on vascular function.
PG  - 512-520
LID - 10.1111/sms.14106 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the short- and long-term effects of high-intensity interval 
      training (HIIT) with usual care moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) on 
      systemic vascular function and stiffness in patients with coronary artery disease 
      undergoing a cardiac rehabilitation program. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. 
      METHODS: Fifty-four patients (age = 63 ± 8 years, 93% male) were randomized to 
      complete 3 sessions/week (2 supervised, 1 home-based) of either (1) 4 × 4-min HIIT 
      or (2) 40-min MICT, for 4 weeks. Patients then continued 3 unsupervised home-based 
      sessions/week of their allocated training for 11 months. Brachial artery 
      flow-mediated dilation, pulse wave velocity, and blood pressure were measured at 
      baseline, 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Data were analyzed using 
      linear mixed modeling and are presented as mean change from baseline (95% CI). 
      RESULTS: HIIT showed a greater improvement in flow-mediated dilation compared to 
      MICT after 4 weeks [1.5% (0.9, 2.1) vs 0.1% (-0.5, 0.8); p = 0.004) but not 
      12 months [1.2% (-0.2, 2.5) vs 0.4% (-0.8, 1.7); p = 0.153). There were no short- or 
      long-term group differences for changes in pulse wave velocity, peripheral or 
      central blood pressure between HIIT and MICT after 4 weeks, or over 12 months. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A 4-week HIIT program was superior to MICT for improving vascular 
      function, but not arterial stiffness or blood pressure. Over 12 months, changes in 
      vascular function, blood pressure, and arterial stiffness were similar for HIIT and 
      MICT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parents are children's primary role models, are food and physical 
      activity gatekeepers, and create the home structure/lifestyle environment. Thus, 
      parents strongly influence children's weight-related behaviors and have the 
      opportunity to cultivate a "culture of health" within the home. Yet, there is a 
      dearth of evidence-based obesity prevention intervention programs, especially for 
      families with children aged 6-11 years, commonly called middle childhood. METHODS: 
      The aim of the HomeStyles-2 online learning mode RCT is to determine whether this 
      novel, age-appropriate, family intervention enables and motivates parents to shape 
      home environments and weight-related lifestyle practices (i.e.,diet, exercise, 
      sleep) to be more supportive of optimal health and reduced obesity risk in middle 
      childhood youth more than those in the control condition. The RCT will include the 
      experimental group and an attention control group. The participants will be parents 
      with school-age children who are systematically randomly assigned by computer to 
      study condition. The HomeStyles intervention is predicated on the social cognitive 
      theory and a social ecological framework. The RCT will collect sociodemographic 
      characteristics of the participant, child, and partner/spouse; child and parent 
      health status; parent weight-related cognitions; weight-related behaviors of the 
      parent and child; and weight-related characteristics of the home environment. 
      Deliverables Enrollment for this study will begin in 2022. DISCUSSION: This paper 
      describes these aspects of the HomeStyles-2 intervention: rationale; sample 
      eligibility criteria and recruitment; study design; experimental group intervention 
      theoretical and philosophical underpinnings, structure, content, and development 
      process; attention control intervention; survey instrument development and 
      components; outcome measures; and planned analyses. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Effects of Weather Parameters on Endurance Running Performance: Discipline-specific 
      Analysis of 1258 Races.
PG  - 153-161
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000002769 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study evaluated how single or combinations of weather parameters 
      (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar load) affect peak performance during 
      endurance running events and identified which events are most vulnerable to varying 
      weather conditions. METHODS: Results for the marathon, 50-km racewalking, 20-km 
      racewalking, and 10,000-, 5000-, and 3000-m steeplechase were obtained from the 
      official Web sites of large competitions. We identified meteorological data from 
      nearby (8.9 ± 9.3 km) weather stations for 1258 races held between 1936 and 2019 
      across 42 countries, enabling analysis of 7867 athletes. RESULTS: The wet bulb globe 
      temperature (WBGT) across races ranged from -7°C to 33°C, with 27% of races taking 
      place in cold/cool, 47% in neutral, 18% in moderate heat, 7% in high heat, and 1% in 
      extreme heat conditions, according to the World Athletics classification. Machine 
      learning decision trees (R2 = 0.21-0.58) showed that air temperature (importance 
      score = 40%) was the most important weather parameter. However, when used alone, air 
      temperature had lower predictive power (R2 = 0.04-0.34) than WBGT (R2 = 0.11-0.47). 
      Conditions of 7.5°C-15°C WBGT (or 10°C-17.5°C air temperature) increased the 
      likelihood for peak performance. For every degree WBGT outside these optimum 
      conditions, performance declined by 0.3%-0.4%. CONCLUSION: More than one-quarter of 
      endurance running events were held in moderate, high, or extreme heat, and this 
      number reached one-half when marathons were excluded. All four weather parameters 
      should be evaluated when aiming to mitigate the health and performance implications 
      of exercising at high intensities in a hot environment with athletes adopting heat 
      mitigation strategies when possible.

TI  - Malnutrition modifies the response to multimodal prehabilitation: a pooled analysis 
      of prehabilitation trials.
PG  - 141-150
LID - 10.1139/apnm-2021-0299 [doi]
AB  - Patients with colorectal cancer are at risk of malnutrition before surgery. 
      Multimodal prehabilitation (nutrition, exercise, stress reduction) readies patients 
      physically and mentally for their operation. However, it is unclear whether extent 
      of malnutrition influences prehabilitation outcomes. We conducted a pooled analysis 
      from five 4-week multimodal prehabilitation trials in colorectal cancer surgery 
      (prehabilitation: n = 195; control: n = 71). Each patient's nutritional status was 
      evaluated at baseline using the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment 
      (PG-SGA; higher score, greater need for treatment of malnutrition). Functional 
      walking capacity was measured with the 6-minute walk test distance (6MWD) at 
      baseline and before surgery. A multivariable mixed effects logistic regression model 
      evaluated the potential modifying effect of PG-SGA on a clinically meaningful change 
      of ≥19 m in 6MWD before surgery. Multimodal prehabilitation increased the odds by 
      3.4 times that colorectal cancer patients improved their 6MWD before surgery as 
      compared with control (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.6 to 7.3; P = 0.001, n = 
      220). Nutritional status significantly modified this outcome (P = 0.007): Neither 
      those patients with PG-SGA ≥9 (adjusted odds ratio: 1.3; 95% CI: 0.23 to 7.2, P = 
      0.771, n = 39) nor PG-SGA <4 (adjusted odds ratio: 1.3; 95% CI: 0.5 to 3.8, P = 
      0.574, n = 87) improved in 6MWD with prehabilitation. In conclusion, baseline 
      nutritional status modifies prehabilitation effectiveness before colorectal cancer 
      surgery. Patients with a PG-SGA score 4-8 appear to benefit most (physically) from 
      4 weeks of multimodal prehabilitation. Novelty: Nutritional status is an effect 
      modifier of prehabilitation physical function outcomes. Patients with a PG-SGA score 
      4-8 benefited physically from 4 weeks of multimodal prehabilitation.

TI  - High intramuscular triglyceride turnover rates and the link to insulin sensitivity: 
      Influence of obesity, type 2 diabetes and physical activity.
LID - 10.1139/apnm-2021-0631 [doi]
AB  - Large intramuscular triglyceride (IMTG) stores in sedentary, obese individuals have 
      been linked to insulin resistance, yet well-trained athletes exhibit high IMTG 
      levels whilst maintaining insulin sensitivity. Contrary to previous assumptions, it 
      is now known that IMTG content per se does not result in insulin resistance. Rather, 
      insulin resistance is caused, at least in part, by the presence of high 
      concentrations of harmful lipid metabolites, such as diacylglycerols and ceramides 
      in muscle. Several mechanistic differences between obese sedentary individuals and 
      their highly-trained counterparts have been identified, that determine the 
      differential capacity for IMTG synthesis and breakdown in these populations. In this 
      review, we first describe the most up-to-date mechanisms by which a low IMTG 
      turnover rate (both breakdown and synthesis) leads to the accumulation of lipid 
      metabolites and results in skeletal muscle insulin resistance. We then explore 
      current and potential exercise and nutritional strategies which target IMTG turnover 
      in sedentary obese individuals, to improve insulin sensitivity. Overall, improving 
      IMTG turnover should be an important component of successful interventions which aim 
      to prevent the development of insulin resistance in the ever-expanding sedentary, 
      overweight and obese populations. Novelty Bullet points • A description of the most 
      up-to-date mechanisms regulating turnover of the IMTG pool. • An exploration of 
      current and potential exercise/nutritional strategies to target and enhance IMTG 
      turnover in obese individuals • Overall, highlights the importance of improving IMTG 
      turnover to prevent the development of insulin resistance.

TI  - Diet and Physical Activity as Determinants of Continuously Measured Glucose Levels 
      in Persons at High Risk of Type 2 Diabetes.

AB  - We examined how dietary and physical activity behaviors influence fluctuations in 
      blood glucose levels over a seven-day period in people at high risk for diabetes. 
      Twenty-eight participants underwent a mixed meal tolerance test to assess glucose 
      homeostasis at baseline. Subsequently, they wore an accelerometer to assess movement 
      behaviors, recorded their dietary intakes through a mobile phone application, and 
      wore a flash glucose monitoring device that measured glucose levels every 15 min for 
      seven days. Generalized estimating equation models were used to assess the 
      associations of metabolic and lifestyle risk factors with glycemic variability. 
      Higher BMI, amount of body fat, and selected markers of hyperglycemia and insulin 
      resistance from the meal tolerance test were associated with higher mean glucose 
      levels during the seven days. Moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity and 
      polyunsaturated fat intake were independently associated with less variation in 
      glucose levels (CV%). Higher protein and polyunsaturated fatty acid intakes were 
      associated with more time-in-range. In contrast, higher carbohydrate intake was 
      associated with less time-in-range. Our findings suggest that dietary composition (a 
      higher intake of polyunsaturated fat and protein and lower intake of carbohydrates) 
      and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity may reduce fluctuations in glucose levels 
      in persons at high risk of diabetes.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine the association of the frequency component of 
      the weekly PA guidelines on CmH in youth. METHODS: Cross-sectional accelerometer 
      data from the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey included 
      youth age 6-18 yr with ≥4 d, ≥10 h of wear time, and averaging ≥60 min·d-1 of MVPA 
      (n = 656). Participants were categorized into quartiles based on the proportion of 
      days where they met the guidelines (≥60 min of MVPA). CmH variables were categorized 
      as weight status/body anthropometrics, blood pressure, cholesterol, and fasting 
      serum laboratory results. Propensity score weighting was applied to quartiles, and 
      general linear modeling was used to compare associations of quartiles with CmH 
      variables. RESULTS: Results are displayed as percent of days meeting guidelines 
      (DMG; 95% confidence interval): MVPA in minutes per week: Q1 (n = 156; DMG = 45.8% 
      (43.4%-48.1%); MVPA 467.5, min·wk-1), Q2 (n = 165; DMG = 62.6% (61.6%-63.7%); MVPA, 
      474.4 min·wk-1), Q3 (n = 148; DMG = 75% (74.1%-75.8%); MVPA, 446.5 min·wk-1), Q4 (n 
      = 187; DMG = 92.2% (87.7%-96.6%); MVPA, 453.2 min·wk-1). After adjusting for 
      confounders and multiple comparisons, there were no clinically significant 
      differences in weight status/body anthropometrics, blood pressure, cholesterol, or 
      fasting serum laboratory results between DMG quartiles. CONCLUSIONS: We found no 
      association between the proportion of DMG and CmH in children and adolescents. Our 
      study suggests that achieving an overall weekly average of 60 min·d-1 of MVPA seems 
      to be sufficient for CmH regardless of the 7 d·wk-1 frequency requirement of the PA 
      guideline.

AB  - Older adults are encouraged to engage in multicomponent physical activity, which 
      includes aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. The current work is an 
      extension of the Vitality, Independence, and Vigor in the Elderly 2 (VIVE2) study - 
      a 6-month multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of physical activity and 
      nutritional supplementation in community dwelling 70-year-old seniors. Here, we 
      examined whether the magnitude of changes in muscle size and quality differed 
      between major lower-extremity muscle groups and related these changes to functional 
      outcomes. We also examined whether daily vitamin-D-enriched protein supplementation 
      could augment the response to structured physical activity. Forty-nine men and women 
      (77 ± 5 yrs) performed brisk walking, muscle-strengthening exercises for the lower 
      limbs, and balance training 3 times weekly for 6 months. Participants were 
      randomized to daily intake of a nutritional supplement (20 g whey protein + 800 IU 
      vitamin D), or a placebo. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and radiological 
      attenuation (RA) were assessed in 8 different muscle groups using single-slice CT 
      scans of the hip, thigh, and calf at baseline and after the intervention. Walking 
      speed and performance in the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) were also 
      measured. For both CSA and RA, there were muscle group × time interactions 
      (P < 0.01). Significant increases in CSA were observed in 2 of the 8 muscles 
      studied, namely the knee extensors (1.9%) and the hip adductors (2.8%). For RA, 
      increases were observed in 4 of 8 muscle groups, namely the hip flexors (1.1 HU), 
      hip adductors (0.9 HU), knee extensors (1.2 HU), and ankle dorsiflexors (0.8 HU). No 
      additive effect of nutritional supplementation was observed. While walking speed 
      (13%) and SPPB performance (38%) improved markedly, multivariate analysis showed 
      that these changes were not associated with the changes in muscle CSA and RA after 
      the intervention. We conclude that this type of multicomponent physical activity 
      program results in significant improvements in physical function despite relatively 
      small changes in muscle size and quality of some, but not all, of the measured lower 
      extremity muscles involved in locomotion.

TI  - Life before and after COVID-19: The 'New Normal' Benefits the Regularity of Daily 
      Sleep and Eating Routines among College Students.
LID - 10.3390/nu14020351 [doi]
LID - 351
AB  - After the COVID-19 lockdown, a 'new normal' was established, involving a hybrid 
      lifestyle that combined face-to-face with virtual activity. We investigated, in a 
      case-control study, the impact of the 'new normal' on daily sleep and eating 
      routines, compared with pre-pandemic conditions. To do this, we propose using social 
      and eating jet lag as markers of the regularity in daily routines. Additionally, we 
      studied whether the 'new normal' had an impact on the body mass index (BMI), diet 
      quality, and other health-related variables. This study included 71 subjects in the 
      pre-pandemic group, and 68 in the 'new normal' group (20-30 years). For all 
      participants, we evaluated social and eating jet lag, BMI, diet and sleep quality, 
      eating behaviors, physical activity, and well-being. General linear models were used 
      to compare outcome variables between pre-pandemic and 'new normal' groups. The 
      results revealed that the 'new normal' was associated with greater regularity in 
      daily sleep and eating routines (-0.7 h of social jet lag (95% CI: -1.0, -0.4), and 
      -0.3 h of eating jet lag (95% CI: -0.5, -0.1)), longer sleep duration on weekdays 
      (1.8 h (95% CI: 1.5, 2.2)), and lower sleep debt (-1.3 h (95% CI: -1.7, -0.9)). 
      Regarding BMI and other health-related variables, we observed that these variables 
      were similar between 'new normal' and pre-pandemic groups. These findings indicate 
      that the 'new normal' had a positive impact on daily sleep and eating routines. 
      Additionally, our results indicated that the 'new normal' offered college students a 
      more sustainable lifestyle, which was associated with more hours of sleep during the 
      week and lower sleep debt. This, in the long run, could have a positive impact on 
      BMI and overall health.

TI  - Benefits of Fruit and Vegetable Consumption on Prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome Are 
      Independent of Physical Activity Behaviors in Older Adults.
LID - 10.3390/nu14020263 [doi]
LID - 263
AB  - Although consumption of fruits and vegetables (FV) is suggested to reduce metabolic 
      risk, there is a paucity of studies taking advantage of objectively assessed 
      physical activity (PA) behaviors when exploring links between FV intake and 
      metabolic syndrome (MetS) in older adults. The aim of the present study was to 
      determine the relationship between FV intake and MetS prevalence in a population of 
      older community-dwelling adults, while considering time spent being sedentary and 
      health-enhancing PA. Prevalence of MetS was determined in a population of 93 men and 
      152 women (age: 65-70 years). FV intake was determined by self-report and PA 
      behaviors (time spent in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and in sedentary) were 
      assessed by accelerometry. Likelihood of having MetS by FV intake was determined 
      using logistic regression with stepwise backward elimination including age, sex, 
      educational level, total energy intake, adherence to MVPA guideline and total 
      sedentary time as covariates. A main finding was that lower FV intakes were 
      significantly related to higher prevalence of MetS (odds ratio [OR]: 1.23; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.47) after considering potential influences by 
      covariates. Additionally, we found that lower intake of vegetables but not fruits 
      was significantly related to higher prevalence of MetS (OR: 1.47; 95%CI: 1.04-2.07). 
      In conclusion, lower intakes of FV in general, and of vegetables in particular, 
      significantly increased likelihood of MetS, regardless of time spent sedentary and 
      adherence to the MVPA guideline. From a public health perspective, our findings 
      emphasize adequate intakes of FV as an independent contributor to metabolic health 
      status in older adults.

TI  - High-Intensity Interval Training Improves Cardiac Autonomic Function in Patients 
      with Type 2 Diabetes: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.3390/biology11010066 [doi]
LID - 66
AB  - Different exercise models have been used in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      (T2D), like moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) and high intensity 
      interval training (HIIT); however, their effects on autonomic modulation are 
      unknown. The present study aimed to compare the effects of different exercise modes 
      on autonomic modulation in patients with T2D. In total, 44 adults with >5 years of 
      T2D diagnosis were recruited and stratified into three groups: HIIT-30:30 (n = 15, 
      age 59.13 ± 5.57 years) that performed 20 repetitions of 30 s at 100% of VO2peak 
      with passive recovery, HIIT-2:2 (n = 14, age 61.20 ± 2.88) that performed 5 
      repetitions of 2 min at 100% of VO2peak with passive recovery, and MICT (n = 15, age 
      58.50 ± 5.26) that performed 14 min of continuous exercise at 70% of VO2peak. All 
      participants underwent anamnesis and evaluation of cardiorespiratory fitness and 
      cardiac autonomic modulation. All protocols were equated by total distance and were 
      performed two times per week for 8 weeks. Group × time interactions were observed 
      for resting heart rate (HRrest) [F(2.82) = 3.641; p = 0.031] and SDNN [F(2.82) = 
      3.462; p = 0.036]. Only the HIIT-30:30 group significantly reduced SDNN (p = 0.002 
      and 0.025, respectively). HRrest reduced more in the HIIT-30:30 group compared with 
      the MICT group (p = 0.038). Group × time interactions were also observed for offTAU 
      [F(2.82) = 3.146; p = 0.048] and offTMR [F(2.82) = 4.424; p = 0.015]. The MICT group 
      presented increased values of offTAU compared with the HIIT-30:30 and HIIT-2:2 
      groups (p = 0.001 and 0.013, respectively), representing a slower HR response after 
      eight weeks of intervention. HIIT, specially HIIT-30:30, represents a promising 
      measure for improving autonomic modulation in patients with T2D.

TI  - Clustering based on comorbidities in patients with chronic heart failure: an 
      illustration of clinical diversity.
PG  - 614-626
LID - 10.1002/ehf2.13704 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: It is increasingly recognized that the presence of comorbidities substantially 
      contributes to the disease burden in patients with heart failure (HF). Several 
      reports have suggested that clustering of comorbidities can lead to improved 
      characterization of the disease phenotypes, which may influence management of the 
      individual patient. Therefore, we aimed to cluster patients with HF based on medical 
      comorbidities and their treatment and, subsequently, compare the clinical 
      characteristics between these clusters. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 603 patients 
      with HF entering an outpatient HF rehabilitation programme were included [median age 
      65 years (interquartile range 56-71), 57% ischaemic origin of cardiomyopathy, and 
      left ventricular ejection fraction 35% (26-45)]. Exercise performance, daily life 
      activities, disease-specific health status, coping styles, and personality traits 
      were assessed. In addition, the presence of 12 clinically relevant comorbidities was 
      recorded, based on targeted diagnostics combined with applicable pharmacotherapies. 
      Self-organizing maps (SOMs; www.viscovery.net) were used to visualize clusters, 
      generated by using a hybrid algorithm that applies the classical hierarchical 
      cluster method of Ward on top of the SOM topology. Five clusters were identified: 
      (1) a least comorbidities cluster; (2) a cachectic/implosive cluster; (3) a 
      metabolic diabetes cluster; (4) a metabolic renal cluster; and (5) a psychologic 
      cluster. Exercise performance, daily life activities, disease-specific health 
      status, coping styles, personality traits, and number of comorbidities were 
      significantly different between these clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct combinations 
      of comorbidities could be identified in patients with HF. Therapy may be tailored 
      based on these clusters as next step towards precision medicine. The effect of such 
      an approach needs to be prospectively tested.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study examined the effect of moderate intensity stair 
      stepping exercise on the glycemic response, and antioxidant capacity (TAC) during an 
      oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty participants 
      (women = 12) completed 4 OGTTs during rest or stair walking bouts of 1, 3, and 
      10 min in a randomized order. Blood was collected at baseline and 30 min during the 
      OGTTs and analyzed for glucose, insulin, TAC, and lactate. Glucose concentrations 
      were decreased following the 10 min (-22.69 (-34.66 to -10.72) mg/dL, p < 0.002) and 
      3 min (-15.37 (-25.05 to -5.69) mg/dL, p < 0.004) bouts but not the 1 min bout 
      (-6.18 (-19.54 to 7.18) mg/dL, p = 0.352). Insulin concentrations were decreased 
      following the 10 min (-6.11 (-8.86 to -3.36 μIU/dL), p < 0.001) and 3 min (-2.589 
      (-4.54 to -0.63) μIU/dL, p < 0.012) bouts but not the 1 min bout (-0.37 (-1.87 to 
      1.13) μIU/dL, p = 0.616). Insulin sensitivity index values showed a significant 
      increase in the 10-min trial (1.81 (0.03-3.58), p < 0.048), but not during the 3 min 
      (0.65 (-0.66 to 1.96) p = 0.317) or 1 min trial (0.13 (-1.58 to 1.84) p = 0.878). 
      There was no omnibus effect for trial in TAC (p = 0.132, η(2) = 0.07). There was no 
      interaction between trial and time for blood lactate (p = 0.621, η(2) = 0.02). 
      CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence bouts as short as 3 min decrease 
      postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels but longer bouts are needed to affect 
      insulin sensitivity.

TI  - Finding "Zen" in Aphasia: The Benefits of Yoga as Described by Key Stakeholders.
PG  - 133-147
LID - 10.1044/2021_AJSLP-20-00330 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Recently, the literature has witnessed a surging interest regarding the use 
      of mind-body approaches with people who have aphasia, generating a plethora of 
      possible outcome measures. During this same time, a core outcome set for aphasia has 
      been recommended. The purpose of this clinical focus article is to give our 
      survivor, co-survivor, and clinician stakeholder coauthors a platform to share their 
      personal narrative regarding their yoga journey, with the goal of identifying 
      primary outcome domains central to capturing the impact of yoga on the recovery 
      process for people with poststroke aphasia. Ultimately, we hope this clinical focus 
      article helps clinicians understand how yoga might benefit their patients and draws 
      attention to potential outcome measures, while also highlighting the important fact 
      that traditional aphasia assessments do not capture the improvements stakeholders 
      pinpoint as crucial to the essence of mind-body interventions. METHOD: This clinical 
      focus article summarizes the case reports of Terri's and Chase's poststroke yoga 
      journeys using the power of personal narrative and an adapted photovoice method. 
      Additional stakeholders share in this storytelling process, using a variety of 
      narrative tools. As this story is unveiled, several patient-identified outcome 
      domains are highlighted as essential to document the impact of yoga on survivors. 
      RESULTS: Terri's and Chase's yoga journeys revealed the multifaceted impact of yoga 
      on five domains: (a) feelings of wholeness and "zen," (b) increased attentional 
      capacity for language tasks, (c) increased verbal fluency, (d) decreased pain, and 
      (e) relationship mutuality. CONCLUSION: Team Yoga realized that the practice of 
      yoga-whether as a stand-alone practice or integrated into therapy sessions-fosters 
      feelings of wholeness or "zen," which likely correlates with decreased pain with a 
      simultaneous increase in resilience and flexibility of coping strategies to manage 
      the host of chronic poststroke challenges. Supplemental Material

TI  - Prevalence of Female Athlete Triad Risk Factors among Female International 
      Volunteers and College Age-Matched Controls.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19031223 [doi]
LID - 1223
AB  - This study retrospectively compared the prevalence of factors related to the female 
      athlete triad (low energy availability, secondary amenorrhea (SA), low bone mineral 
      density (BMD)), and post-study BMD of female college students and female 
      international volunteer missionaries (volunteers). Female college students (21-26 
      years) completed a survey that retrospectively assessed an 18-month study period 
      (volunteer service or first 18 months of college); Diet History Questionnaire III 
      (DHQ III) and Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scan were optional. One-way 
      ANOVAs and chi-squared distributions assessed group differences. Logistic regression 
      assessed covariates of SA and BMD; corresponding odds ratios (OR) and confidence 
      intervals (CI) were calculated. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.001. 3683 
      participants (58.8% volunteers, 31.5% non-volunteers, 9.8% others) provided complete 
      survey data; 246 completed the DHQ III, and 640 had a post-study DXA scan. 
      Volunteers had higher metabolic equivalent (MET) hours than non-volunteers and 
      others (p < 0.001), and higher prevalence of food insecurity (p < 0.001) and SA (p < 
      0.001). Volunteers had higher odds of SA (OR = 2.17, CI = 1.75-2.62) than 
      non-volunteers. Weight loss, body satisfaction, "other" weight loss methods, 
      increased MET hours, and vomiting during the study period increased participants' 
      odds of SA. Participants' average BMD Z-scores were within the expected range at all 
      sites, with no significant group differences. Volunteers' higher MET hours and 
      higher prevalence of food insecurity and SA did not result in significantly lower 
      post-study period BMD.

LID - 10.3233/WOR-210905 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic took root in the United States, most 
      universities quickly transitioned to online and remained there through spring 2021. 
      OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to identify the impact of the switch to online on 
      student home offices and corresponding health outcomes. METHODS: An online survey 
      was sent out to all student at a large Midwest university to assess the work 
      practices and health outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 1074 responses were completed. The 
      shift to online not only resulted in most students utilizing laptop computers 
      without external monitors, keyboards, or mouse input devices, but also a major 
      increase in the amount of time spent using technology (on average 31 to 40 hours per 
      week). The amount of severe to extreme discomfort in the neck, shoulder, upper back, 
      and lower back was alarming (above 41%). CONCLUSION: The home offices of students 
      were often sub-optimal, indicating the need to educate university students.

TI  - The mediating effect of engagement in physical activity over a 24-hour period on 
      chronic disease and depression: Using compositional mediation model.

LID - S0165-0327(21)01337-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jad.2021.12.019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Popular mediation method only considers a single activity as a mediator 
      instead of all 24-hour physical activity, such as a four-way decomposition method. 
      We investigated the mediation of 24-hour movement continuum between chronic diseases 
      (cardiovascular disease [CVD] and diabetes) and depression using a novel 
      compositional mediation model. METHODS: 24-hour activity data measured by 
      accelerometer were obtained from NHANES 2005-2006. Adjusted coefficient with 95% 
      confidence interval (95% CI) for PHQ-9 total score and adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 
      95% CI for depression were computed from compositional mediation models. RESULTS: In 
      total, 2,375 participants aged ≥ 20 were included in our analysis. Both diabetes and 
      CVD were associated with increased sedentary behavior (SB) and sleep and reduced 
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and light-intensity physical activity 
      (LPA), leading to an increased likelihood of depression. Although not all component 
      indirect effects were associated with PHQ-9 total score and depression, the total 
      indirect effect was significantly associated with both PHQ-9 total score 
      (coefficient (95% CI) for diabetes: 0.162 (0.081, 0.261); coefficient (95% CI) for 
      CVD: 1.139 (1.061, 1.240)) and depression (OR (95% CI) for diabetes: 0.235 (0.126, 
      0.362); OR (95% CI) for CVD: 1.200 (1.088, 1.346)) using the compositional mediation 
      model. CONCLUSION: We developed a compositional mediation model for continuous and 
      binary outcomes, which can handle entire compositional mediators as a unit. The 
      mediation of 24-hour movement continuum mediated the association between diabetes, 
      CVD, and depression. Our findings present potential interventions for reducing risk 
      of depression among patients with CVD and diabetes.

TI  - Intake of n-3 LCPUFA and trans-fatty acids is unrelated to development in body mass 
      index and body fat among children.
PG  - 1

AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of children and adolescents with obesity has increased 
      worldwide. Some studies have found an increase in the intake of n-3 long-chain 
      polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) to be beneficial for weight and obesity status. 
      The objectives of this study were to examine if intake of trans-fatty acids (TFA) 
      and n-3 LCPUFA at school start was associated with weight and body fat development 
      in the following 3 and 7 years, and if substituting other fats for n-3 LCPUFA in 
      regression models influenced weight and body fat development. METHODS: A total of 
      285 children (boys:130, girls:155) were included in this study. Weight, height and 
      skinfold thickness (SF) of children were measured at age 6, 9 and 13 years by 
      trained research personnel. Multivariate linear regression models were used to 
      investigate the associations between n-3 LCPUFA or TFA intake and subsequent changes 
      in body mass index (BMI) or SF. To investigate substitution effects, we constructed 
      regression models including information on n-3 LCPUFA and all other energy given 
      components of the diet, except for the nutrient to be substituted (all other fats 
      and specific subgroups; saturated fatty acids (SFAs), monounsaturated fatty acids 
      (MUFAs) and other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)). RESULTS: No significant 
      associations were observed between intake of TFA or n-3 LCPUFA and changes in BMI 
      and SF. Also, results from regression analysis showed substituting other fats for 
      n-3 LCPUFA did not associate with BMI or SF development. CONCLUSION: The lack of 
      associations between n-3 LCPUFA and TFA and adiposity suggests that fat composition 
      in the diet does not play a major role in obesity development among school-aged 
      children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine the glucometabolic effects of 
      acute activation of G(s) signaling in skeletal muscle (SKM) in vivo and its 
      contribution to whole-body glucose homeostasis. METHODS: To address this question, 
      we studied mice that express a G(s)-coupled designer G protein-coupled receptor 
      (Gs-DREADD or GsD) selectively in skeletal muscle. We also identified two 
      G(s)-coupled GPCRs that are endogenously expressed by SKM at relatively high levels 
      (β(2)-adrenergic receptor and CRF(2) receptor) and studied the acute metabolic 
      effects of activating these receptors in vivo by highly selective agonists 
      (clenbuterol and urocortin 2 (UCN2), respectively). RESULTS: Acute stimulation of 
      GsD signaling in SKM impaired glucose tolerance in lean and obese mice by decreasing 
      glucose uptake selectively into SKM. The acute metabolic effects following agonist 
      activation of β(2)-adrenergic and, potentially, CRF(2) receptors appear primarily 
      mediated by altered insulin release. Clenbuterol injection improved glucose 
      tolerance by increasing insulin secretion in lean mice. In SKM, clenbuterol 
      stimulated glycogen breakdown. UCN2 injection resulted in decreased glucose 
      tolerance associated with lower plasma insulin levels. The acute metabolic effects 
      of UCN2 were not mediated by SKM G(s) signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Selective activation 
      of G(s) signaling in SKM causes an acute increase in blood glucose levels. However, 
      acute in vivo stimulation of endogenous G(s)-coupled receptors enriched in SKM has 
      only a limited impact on whole-body glucose homeostasis, most likely due to the fact 
      that these receptors are also expressed by pancreatic islets where they modulate 
      insulin release.

AB  - Consumer digital technology is rapidly evolving, allowing users to manage their 
      health in a simple, non-invasive manner. However, there are few studies revealing if 
      using digital technology as part of an intervention really has an impact in consumer 
      health compared with traditional strategies. The objective of the current study is 
      to compare two groups (MTB; n = 18, 46.1 ± 10.4 years and MTBAPP; n = 19, 45.3 ± 
      6.40 years) of overweight, prehypertensive individuals in losing weight and lowering 
      their blood pressure. Both were provided with nutritionist-guided recommendations, a 
      wearable tracking device and a dietary supplement that has previously been proven to 
      help lose body weight and lower blood pressure. In addition, one of the groups 
      (MTBAPP) used a mobile app specifically designed for the intervention. Blood 
      pressure, body composition, triglyceride level, peak expiratory flow, forced 
      expiratory volume in the first second and maximum oxygen volume were measured at 
      different time points. In addition, participants were monitored with an activity 
      bracelet throughout the intervention. As a result, both groups significantly lost 
      body weight, while the group using the app additionally improved blood pressure 
      levels and lowered fat mass. Furthermore, the app users significantly increased the 
      number of daily steps and decreased sedentary time. In conclusion, the addition of a 
      mobile app with daily reminders to follow healthy lifestyle recommendations 
      increased physical activity and overall improved blood pressure and fat mass levels 
      when compared with a group performing the same intervention but in absence of the 
      mobile application.

TI  - Nutritional supplementation alters associations between one-carbon metabolites and 
      cardiometabolic risk profiles in older adults: a secondary analysis of the Vienna 
      Active Ageing Study.
PG  - 169-182
LID - 10.1007/s00394-021-02607-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cardiovascular diseases and cognitive decline, predominant in ageing 
      populations, share common features of dysregulated one-carbon (1C) and 
      cardiometabolic homeostasis. However, few studies have addressed the impact of 
      multifaceted lifestyle interventions in older adults that combine both nutritional 
      supplementation and resistance training on the co-regulation of 1C metabolites and 
      cardiometabolic markers. METHODS: 95 institutionalised older adults (83 ± 6 years, 
      88.4% female) were randomised to receive resistance training with or without 
      nutritional supplementation (Fortifit), or cognitive training (control for 
      socialisation) for 6 months. Fasting plasma 1C metabolite concentrations, analysed 
      by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, and cardiometabolic 
      parameters were measured at baseline and the 3- and 6-month follow-ups. RESULTS: 
      Regardless of the intervention group, choline was elevated after 3 months, while 
      cysteine and methionine remained elevated after 6 months (mixed model time effects, 
      p < 0.05). Elevated dimethylglycine and lower betaine concentrations were correlated 
      with an unfavourable cardiometabolic profile at baseline (spearman correlations, 
      p < 0.05). However, increasing choline and dimethylglycine concentrations were 
      associated with improvements in lipid metabolism in those receiving supplementation 
      (regression model interaction, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Choline metabolites, including 
      choline, betaine and dimethylglycine, were central to the co-regulation of 1C 
      metabolism and cardiometabolic health in older adults. Metabolites that indicate 
      upregulated betaine-dependent homocysteine remethylation were elevated in those with 
      the greatest cardiometabolic risk at baseline, but associated with improvements in 
      lipid parameters following resistance training with nutritional supplementation. The 
      relevance of how 1C metabolite status might be optimised to protect against 
      cardiometabolic dysregulation requires further attention.

AB  - It is documented that regular exercise is beneficial for improving the antioxidant 
      system, metabolic system, cardiac autonomic function, and blood pressure in those 
      with hypertension. In this regard, low-intensity exercise is recommended for older 
      adults, particularly those with chronic diseases. This study aimed to compare the 
      effects of long-term regular continuous walking with intermittent walking on 
      oxidative stress, metabolic profile, heart rate variability, and blood pressure in 
      older adults with hypertension. Forty-three participants with hypertension aged 
      60-80 years were randomly divided into the continuous or intermittent walking (CON 
      or INT) groups. Participants in the CON group walked for 30 min, 3 days/week for 12 
      weeks. Participants in the INT group split 30 min walking into 3 identical sessions 
      punctuated by a 1 min rest after each session, 3 days/week for 12 weeks. Antioxidant 
      and oxidative stress markers, metabolic markers, heart rate variability, and blood 
      pressure were evaluated before and after the exercise program. Glutathione (GSH), 
      GSH to GSH disulfide (GSSG) ratio, and total GSH increased significantly, and GSSG 
      and malondialdehyde decreased significantly in both groups (p < 0.05) without 
      significant differences between groups. Triglycerides, ratio of total cholesterol to 
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and atherosclerogenic index were significantly 
      lower in the CON group than those in the INT group (p < 0.05). The standard 
      deviation of the NN intervals and root mean square of the successive differences 
      were significantly higher, and low-frequency power was significantly lower in the 
      INT group than that in the CON group (p < 0.05). No significant changes in blood 
      pressure were noted in both groups, and nor were there any significant differences 
      between groups. Long-term regular continuous and intermittent walking may comparably 
      increase antioxidants, reduce oxidative stress, and be beneficial for improving 
      important blood pressure-related outcomes, including metabolic profile or cardiac 
      autonomic function in older adults with hypertension.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of theory-based interventions for direct support 
      professionals (DSPs) to support a healthy lifestyle for people with moderate to 
      profound intellectual disabilities (ID) despite their major role in this. This study 
      aims to evaluate the preparation, implementation, and preliminary outcomes of a 
      theory-based training and education program for DSPs to learn how to support these 
      individuals. METHODS: The program consisting of e-learning, three in-person 
      sessions, and three assignments was implemented. The implementation process was 
      evaluated with a mixed method design with the following components: preparation 
      phase, implementation phase, and the outcomes. These components were measured with 
      project notes, questionnaires, interviews, reflections, assignments, food diaries, 
      Actigraph/Actiwatch, and an inventory of daily activities. RESULTS: Regarding the 
      preparation phase, enough potential participants met the inclusion criteria and the 
      time to recruit the participants was 9 months. The program was implemented in four 
      (residential) facilities and involved individuals with moderate to profound ID 
      (n = 24) and DSPs (n = 32). The e-learning was completed by 81% of the DSPs, 72-88% 
      attended the in-person sessions, and 34-47% completed the assignments. Overall, the 
      fidelity of the program was good. DSPs would recommend the program, although they 
      were either negative or positive about the time investment. Mutual agreement on 
      expectations were important for the acceptability and suitability of the program. 
      For the outcomes, the goals of the program were achieved, and the attitudes of DSPs 
      towards a healthy lifestyle were improved after 3 months of the program (nutrition: 
      p = < 0.01; physical activity: p = 0.04). A statistically significant improvement 
      was found for food intake of people with ID (p = 0.047); for physical activity, no 
      statistically significant differences were determined. CONCLUSIONS: The theory-based 
      program consisting of a training and education section for DSPs to support a healthy 
      lifestyle for people with moderate to profound ID was feasible to implement and, 
      despite some barriers regarding time capacity and mutual expectations, it delivered 
      positive changes in both persons with moderate to profound ID and DSPs. Thus, the 
      program is a promising intervention to support DSPs.

AB  - A balanced diet can help in the prevention of chronic diseases. The aim of this 
      study was to evaluate the effect of an mHealth intervention on the distribution of 
      macronutrients and the intake of food groups. A total of 650 participants were 
      included in this multi-center, clinical, randomized, controlled trial (Evident 3 
      study). All participants were given brief advice about diet and exercise. The 
      intervention group received, in addition, an app (Evident 3) for the self-recording 
      of their diet and an activity tracker wristband for 3 months. Follow-up visits were 
      performed at 3 and 12 months to collect the diet composition using the Food 
      Frequency Questionnaire. There were decreases in the intake of total calories, fat, 
      protein and carbohydrates in both groups throughout the study, without significant 
      differences between them. The intervention group reduced the intake of cholesterol 
      (-30.8; 95% CI -59.9, -1.7) and full-fat dairies (-23.3; 95% CI -42.8, -3.8) and 
      increased the intake of wholemeal bread (3.3; 95% CI -6.7, 13.3) and whole-grain 
      cereals (3.4; 95% CI -6.8, 13.7) with respect to the control group. No differences 
      were found in the rest of the nutritional parameters. The brief advice is useful to 
      promote a healthier diet, and the app can be a support tool to obtain changes in 
      relevant foods, such as integral foods, and the intake of cholesterol. Trial 
      registration: ClinicalTrials.gov with identifier NCT03175614.

AB  - This study examined adolescent muscle-strengthening exercise (MSE) participation at 
      home and associated socioecological correlates during Australia's initial COVID-19 
      lockdown restrictions. Adolescents (N = 731, M(age) = 16.3, SD = 1.2 years, 73% 
      female) self-reported their MSE participation in February 2020 (pre-lockdown; at a 
      gym or at home) and April/May (during lockdown; at home only as gyms were closed). 
      They also reported a range of potential individual, family, and home environment 
      correlates. Remoteness and area-level socioeconomic disadvantage were also 
      considered. Logistic regression models examined potential correlates of 
      participation in any MSE and MSE engagement ≥3 times/week during April/May. Fewer 
      adolescents participated in MSE during April/May (48%) than February (54%), however, 
      the proportions that engaged in MSE ≥3 times/week were the same (30%). Prioritising 
      being active every day (OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.52, 3.90), being active with 
      sibling/s ≥ 5 days/week (OR = 2.24, 95% CI = 1.00, 5.00) and access to weights at 
      home (OR = 2.98, 95% CI = 1.94, 4.57) were associated with higher odds of any MSE 
      participation at home during April/May. These variables were also positively 
      associated with MSE participation at home ≥3 times/week. Understanding how to 
      support adolescents to prioritise being active, engage in MSE with siblings, and 
      provide equipment may assist adolescents to engage in home-based MSE.

TI  - Association between physical activity & sedentary time on frailty status in males 
      and females living with diabetes mellitus: A cross-sectional analysis.

LID - S0531-5565(22)00049-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.exger.2022.111741 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) is a cornerstone for the prevention and the 
      treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM) and frailty. However, no consensus exists on 
      which intensities and types of PA are associated with frailty status among 
      individuals living with DM. To investigate the association between different 
      intensities and types of PA on frailty status in males and females living with DM. 
      METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of the 2003-2006 cycles from the National Health 
      and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was performed in 711 participants living 
      with DM. Frailty status was measured using the 43-item deficit model and DM was 
      self-reported. Weekly PA levels were measured by accelerometer, while resistance 
      training (RT) was measured via questionnaire. Linear and logistic regressions were 
      performed to investigate the associations between different intensities and types of 
      PA and frailty status. RESULTS: Total time spent performing light PA was associated 
      with a better frailty status in males (ß - 0.041 ± 0.012; p < 0.001) and females 
      (ß - 0.070 ± 0.010; p < 0.0001), while total moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was 
      associated with a better frailty status in females only (ß-0.235 ± 0.061; p < 0.05). 
      However, once fully adjusted, the different intensities and types of PA were 
      associated more with frailty status for female. When investigating whether different 
      intensities and types of PA were associated with being considered frail, total time 
      spent at MVPA and light PA were associated with higher odds along with total 
      sedentary time for female (all p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Each minute engaged in PA was 
      associated with a better frailty status in males and females living with DM, 
      although RT does not appear associated with a better frailty status in adults with 
      DM. Replacing sedentary time with PA is important, especially for females living 
      with DM to have a better frailty status. These results are important as they provide 
      insights into the prevention and the management of frailty in individuals living 
      with DM.

TI  - Waking up to sleep's role in obesity and blood pressure among Black adolescent girls 
      in low-income, US urban communities: A longitudinal analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify longitudinal bidirectional associations between unique sleep 
      trajectories and obesity and hypertension among Black, adolescent girls. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal data were from a randomized controlled trial 
      (2009-2013) implemented in schools serving low-income communities aimed at 
      preventing obesity among adolescent girls (mean age = 12.2 years (standard deviation 
      ± 0.72). MEASURES: Nocturnal sleep data were extracted from accelerometers at T1 
      (enrollment, n = 470), T2 (6-month, n = 348), and T3 (18-month follow-up, n = 277); 
      height and weight were measured at T1-T3; and systolic/diastolic blood pressure at 
      T1 and T3 using an oscillometric monitor. Multilevel models examined longitudinal 
      associations. Finite mixture models identified sleep trajectory groups. Structural 
      equation models examined whether T1 chronic disease risk predicted sleep profiles, 
      and conversely, if sleep trajectories predicted T3 chronic disease risk. Data were 
      analyzed in 2021. RESULTS: For each additional hour of sleep and 1% increase in 
      efficiency there was a 7% lower risk of overweight/obesity at T1 and 6% lower risk 
      at T2, but not at T3. Four sleep trajectories emerged: Worsened, Irregular, 
      Improved, and Regular, with no demographic or metabolic differences between the 
      trajectories. Improved sleep trajectory predicted lower diastolic percentile at T3 
      (b = -8.81 [95% confidence interval -16.23, -1.40]). CONCLUSIONS: Group-based 
      trajectories of sleep duration and quality provide information on modifiable factors 
      that can be targeted in interventions to evaluate their impact on reducing chronic 
      diseases and addressing disparities. Additional research is needed on samples beyond 
      those recruited in the context of an intervention study.

AB  - PURPOSE: Racial and ethnic minorities in the state of Washington experience higher 
      cancer mortality relative to whites. We sought to characterize differences in travel 
      distance to radiation therapy (RT) facilities in Washington by race and ethnicity 
      with a special focus on non-Hispanic American Indians and Alaska Natives as a 
      contributor to limited access and cancer disparities. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 
      Geocoded mortality data from Washington Department of Health (2011-2018) were used 
      to identify decedents with mortality related to all-causes, all cancers, and cancers 
      likely requiring access to RT. This was determined from optimal RT usage estimates 
      by diagnosis. RT facility locations were ascertained from the Directory of Radiation 
      Therapy Centers and confirmed. Distance from decedents' address listed on death 
      certificates to nearest RT facility was calculated. Generalized mixed models were 
      used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: We identified 418,754 deaths; 109,134 were 
      cancer-related, 60,973 likely required RT. Among decedents with cancers likely 
      requiring RT, non-Hispanic American Indians and Alaska Natives decedents would have 
      had to travel 1.16 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.24) farther from 
      their residences to reach the nearest treatment facility compared with non-Hispanic 
      whites. This association existed in metro counties but was more pronounced in 
      nonmetro counties (1.39 times farther; 95% CI, 1.22-1.58). In addition, Hispanics 
      would have had to travel 1.11 times farther (95% CI, 1.06-1.16) to reach the nearest 
      facility compared with non-Hispanic whites, primarily due to differences in urban 
      counties. Decedents in nonmetro counties lived on average 35 miles (SD = 29) from RT 
      centers and non-Hispanic American Indians and Alaska Natives in nonmetro counties 53 
      miles (SD = 38). Compared with non-Hispanic white decedents, those who were 
      non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, and non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian decedents 
      lived closer to RT facilities. CONCLUSIONS: We observed significant disparities in 
      access to RT facilities in Washington, specifically for non-Hispanic American 
      Indians and Alaska Natives and rural decedents. The findings call for initiatives to 
      improve access to critical cancer treatment services for these underserved 
      populations with known disparities in cancer deaths.

TI  - Chronic Consumption of Cocoa Rich in Procyanidins Has a Marginal Impact on Gut 
      Microbiota and on Serum and Fecal Metabolomes in Male Endurance Athletes.
PG  - 1878-1889
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.1c07547 [doi]
AB  - Cocoa is used in the sports world as a supplement, although there is no consensus on 
      its use. We investigated the effect of cocoa intake on intestinal ischemia 
      (intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP)), serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 
      levels, gastrointestinal symptoms, and gut microbiota in endurance athletes during 
      their training period on an unrestricted diet. We also performed a metabolomics 
      analysis of serum and feces after a bout of exercise before and after 
      supplementation. Cocoa consumption had no effect on I-FABP, LPS, or gastrointestinal 
      symptoms. Cocoa intake significantly increased the abundance of Blautia and 
      Lachnospira genera and decreased the abundance of the Agathobacter genus, which was 
      accompanied by elevated levels of polyphenol fecal metabolites 
      4-hydroxy-5-(phenyl)-valeric acid and O-methyl-epicatechin-O-glucuronide. Our 
      untargeted approach revealed that cocoa had no significant effects on serum and 
      fecal metabolites and that its consumption had little impact on the metabolome after 
      a bout of physical exercise.

TI  - Experiences of Participation in a Multimodal Preventive Trial MIND-AD(MINI) Among 
      Persons with Prodromal Alzheimer's Disease: A Qualitative Study.
PG  - 219-234
LID - 10.2147/JMDH.S345607 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the world's leading public health 
      challenges. One-third of AD cases are attributable to modifiable vascular and 
      lifestyle-related risk factors. The Multimodal Preventive Trial for Alzheimer's 
      Disease, MIND-AD(MINI) a 6-month multinational parallel-group randomized controlled 
      trial (RCT), targeted persons with prodromal AD and built on the positive outcomes 
      from the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and 
      Disability (FINGER) trial. The intervention consisted of four main components of (i) 
      physical exercise training program, (ii) nutrition guidance, (iii) cognitive 
      training, and (iv) social stimulation, as well as (iv) monitoring of 
      metabolic/vascular risk factors. AIM: The study aimed to explore and describe the 
      experiences of participation in MIND-AD(MINI) among persons with prodromal AD. 
      METHODS: This qualitative study was part of the larger MIND-AD(MINI) project. Eight 
      participants were interviewed twice, before and after the intervention. The data was 
      analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The results are presented as 
      categories of (i) knowledge of AD and prevention, (ii) motives for study 
      participation, (iii) experiences of the received information about the study, (iv) 
      taking the decision to participate, (v) expectations on study participation, (vi) 
      experiences of study participation and (vii) internal and external factors 
      influencing study participation. CONCLUSION: The MIND-AD(MINI) was well-tolerated by 
      the participants. At the beginning of the study, the number of tasks and visits was 
      perceived as burdensome but was later well-tolerated. The participant' knowledge 
      about AD and prevention increased during the trial. Their motives for participating 
      in MIND-AD(MINI) were described as both altruistic and self-beneficial. Health 
      benefits from the study components, access to specialized medical care were 
      identified as benefits. Managing the intensive flow of information was described a 
      major challenge. The participants' needs for personalized support during the trial 
      stress the importance of applying a person-centered approach providing the 
      preventive trials.

      Training on Liver Fat: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 862-881
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgab795 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, characterized by excess fat accumulation 
      in the liver, is considered the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Recent 
      findings have shown that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) can reduce liver 
      fat but it is unclear whether this form of exercise is superior to traditional 
      moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic 
      review was to determine the effect of HIIT vs MICT on liver fat in adults. A 
      secondary aim was to investigate the interaction between total weekly exercise 
      volume and exercise-related energy expenditure and change in liver fat. METHODS: 
      Relevant databases were searched up to December 2020 for randomized trials, 
      comparing HIIT to control, MICT to control, or HIIT to MICT. Studies were excluded 
      if they did not implement 2 or more weeks' intervention or assess liver fat using 
      magnetic resonance-based techniques. Weighted mean differences and 95% CIs were 
      calculated. Regression analyses were undertaken to determine the interaction between 
      weekly exercise volume in minutes and kilocalories (kcal) with change in liver fat 
      content. RESULTS: Of the 28 268 studies screened, 19 were included involving 745 
      participants. HIIT and MICT both elicited moderate reductions in liver fat content 
      when compared to control (HIIT: -2.85%, 95% CI, -4.86 to -0.84, P = .005, I2 = 0%, 
      n = 114, low-certainty evidence; MICT: -3.14%, 95% CI, -4.45 to -1.82, P < .001, 
      I2 = 5.2%, n = 533, moderate-certainty evidence). There was no difference between 
      HIIT and MICT (-0.34%, 95% CI, -2.20 to 1.52, P = .721, I2 = 0%, n = 177, 
      moderate-certainty evidence). Neither total exercise volume in minutes (β = .0002, 
      SE = 0.0017, Z = 0.13, P = .89) nor exercise-related energy expenditure in kcal 
      (β = .0003, SE = 0.0002, Z = 1.21, P = .23) were related to changes in liver fat 
      content. CONCLUSION: HIIT elicits comparable improvements in liver fat to MICT 
      despite often requiring less energy and time commitment. Further studies should be 
      undertaken to assess the relative importance of aerobic exercise prescription 
      variables, such as intensity, on liver fat.

TI  - Dietary carbohydrate restriction augments weight loss-induced improvements in 
      glycaemic control and liver fat in individuals with type 2 diabetes: a randomised 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 506-517
LID - 10.1007/s00125-021-05628-8 [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Lifestyle modification and weight loss are cornerstones of type 2 
      diabetes management. However, carbohydrate restriction may have weight-independent 
      beneficial effects on glycaemic control. This has been difficult to demonstrate 
      because low-carbohydrate diets readily decrease body weight. We hypothesised that 
      carbohydrate restriction enhances the beneficial metabolic effects of weight loss in 
      type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This open-label, parallel RCT included adults with type 2 
      diabetes, HbA(1c) 48-97 mmol/mol (6.5-11%), BMI >25 kg/m(2), eGFR >30 ml min(-1) 
      [1.73 m](-2) and glucose-lowering therapy restricted to metformin or dipeptidyl 
      peptidase-4 inhibitors. Participants were randomised by a third party and assigned 
      to 6 weeks of energy restriction (all foods were provided) aiming at ~6% weight loss 
      with either a carbohydrate-reduced high-protein diet (CRHP, percentage of total 
      energy intake [E%]: CH30/P30/F40) or a conventional diabetes diet (CD, E%: 
      CH50/P17/F33). Fasting blood samples, continuous glucose monitoring and magnetic 
      resonance spectroscopy were used to assess glycaemic control, lipid metabolism and 
      intrahepatic fat. Change in HbA(1c) was the primary outcome; changes in circulating 
      and intrahepatic triacylglycerol were secondary outcomes. Data were collected at 
      Copenhagen University Hospital (Bispebjerg and Herlev). RESULTS: Seventy-two adults 
      (CD 36, CRHP 36, all white, 38 male sex) with type 2 diabetes (mean duration 
      8 years, mean HbA(1c) 57 mmol/mol [7.4%]) and mean BMI of 33 kg/m(2) were enrolled, 
      of which 67 (CD 33, CRHP 34) completed the study. Body weight decreased by 5.8 kg 
      (5.9%) in both groups after 6 weeks. Compared with the CD diet, the CRHP diet 
      further reduced HbA(1c) (mean [95% CI] -1.9 [-3.5, -0.3] mmol/mol [-0.18 (-0.32, 
      -0.03)%], p = 0.018) and diurnal mean glucose (mean [95% CI] -0.8 [-1.2, -0.4] 
      mmol/l, p < 0.001), stabilised glucose excursions by reducing glucose CV (mean [95% 
      CI] -4.1 [-5.9, -2.2]%, p < 0.001), and augmented the reductions in fasting 
      triacylglycerol concentration (by mean [95% CI] -18 [-29, -6]%, p < 0.01) and liver 
      fat content (by mean [95% CI] -26 [-45, 0]%, p = 0.051). However, pancreatic fat 
      content was decreased to a lesser extent by the CRHP than the CD diet (mean [95% CI] 
      33 [7, 65]%, p = 0.010). Fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA2-IR and cholesterol 
      concentrations (total, LDL and HDL) were reduced significantly and similarly by both 
      diets. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Moderate carbohydrate restriction for 6 weeks 
      modestly improved glycaemic control, and decreased circulating and intrahepatic 
      triacylglycerol levels beyond the effects of weight loss itself compared with a CD 
      diet in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Concurrent differences in protein and fat 
      intakes, and the quality of dietary macronutrients, may have contributed to these 
      results and should be explored in future studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03814694. FUNDING: The study was funded by Arla Foods amba, 
      The Danish Dairy Research Foundation, and Copenhagen University Hospital Bispebjerg 
      Frederiksberg.

TI  - An m-Health telerehabilitation and health education program on physical performance 
      in patients with hip fracture and their family caregivers: Study protocol for the 
      ActiveHip+ randomized controlled trial.
LID - 10.1002/nur.22218 [doi]
AB  - Telerehabilitation interventions administered via a smartphone may provide new 
      feasible and effective rehabilitation options at home for patients with hip 
      fracture. However, to date, no such interventions have been shown to be effective in 
      the recovery key health outcomes of these patients. The present multicentre 
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to test the effect of the ActiveHip+ m-Health 
      system in the recovery of physical performance, functional level, quality of life, 
      and other health-related outcomes in both patients with hip fracture and their 
      family caregivers. A total of 104 patients older than 65 years, with hip fracture, 
      and their family caregivers will be randomized into the ActiveHip+ rehabilitation 
      (N = 52) or the control group (N = 52). ActiveHip+ is a 12-week smartphone-based 
      rehabilitation program conducted in Granada and Cádiz (Spain) that includes: (1) 24 
      sessions of physical exercise and 12 sessions of occupational therapy; (2) seven 
      educational modules for patients and for caregivers; and (3) general recommendations 
      in activities of daily living. The control group will receive the usual 
      rehabilitation protocol offered by the Andalusian Public Healthcare System. The 
      primary outcome is the patient's physical performance, while the secondary outcomes 
      are the patient's functional level, quality of life, pain, fear of falling, fitness 
      perception, pre-fracture functional level, emotional status, and caregiver burden. 
      The present project will substantially contribute to the existing knowledge by 
      testing for the first time the efficacy and feasibility of a multidisciplinary 
      m-Health system in the rehabilitation of patients with hip fracture.

TI  - Direct Observation of COVID-19 Prevention Behaviors and Physical Activity in Public 
      Open Spaces.

AB  - Mask wearing and physical distancing are effective at preventing COVID-19 
      transmission. Little is known about the practice of these behaviors during physical 
      activity (PA). In this longitudinal study, direct observation was used to describe 
      COVID-19 prevention behaviors among physically active individuals. The Viral 
      Transmission Scan (VT-Scan) was used to assess COVID-19 prevention behaviors of 
      people standing, sitting, walking, jogging, and cycling in educational, retail, and 
      residential areas. The VT-Scan was performed once per week over 22 weeks between 
      11:00 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. Information was manually extracted from videos collected 
      during VT-Scans. A total of 4153 people were described, of which 71.2% were 
      physically active, 80.0% were 18-30 years of age, 14.0% were non-white, 61.0% were 
      female, and were 19.6% obese. Individuals not engaged in PA were less compliant with 
      COVID-19 prevention behaviors than physically active people. Compliance differed by 
      PA type, with walkers less compliant with COVID-19 prevention behaviors than joggers 
      and cyclists. Among those physically active, non-compliance with COVID-19 prevention 
      behaviors was higher in 18-30-year-olds, whites, and men. Engagement in COVID-19 
      prevention behaviors varies as a function of PA. Efforts to promote compliance with 
      recommendations may benefit from tailored messaging, taking into account PA 
      participation, PA type, and characteristics of physically active individuals.

AB  - The aim of this study was to apply the Multi-Process Action Control model to examine 
      how the additions of regulatory and reflexive processes predict physical activity 
      (PA) behaviors among adolescents. Our sample included 1,176 Grade 11 students (Mage 
      = 15.85 ± 0.38) recruited from a large school board in Southern Ontario. 
      Participants completed a questionnaire including measures of self-reported PA and PA 
      cognitions derived from the Multi-Process Action Control model. Results found the 
      reflective process explaining 16.5% of the variance in PA, with the additions of 
      regulatory and reflexive processes significantly improving the explained variance by 
      5.1% and 8.2%, respectively. Final models revealed coping planning (estimate = 
      45.10, p = .047), identity (estimate = 55.82, p < .001), and habit (estimate = 
      64.07, p < .001) as significant predictors of PA. Findings reinforce the need for 
      integrative models to better understand PA, with coping planning, habit formation, 
      and development of an active identity to be salient targets for intervention during 
      adolescence.

TI  - Is having a 20-minute neighbourhood associated with eating out behaviours and 
      takeaway home delivery? A cross-sectional analysis of ProjectPLAN.
PG  - 191
LID - 10.1186/s12889-022-12587-1 [doi]
LID - 191
AB  - BACKGROUND: Through improved service provision and accessibility, 20-min 
      neighbourhoods (20MNs) aim to enable people to meet most of their daily (non-work) 
      needs within 20 min from home. Associations between 20MNs and food practices remain 
      unknown. This study examines links with the frequency and location of eating out 
      behaviours as well as the frequency of home food delivery. METHODS: This 
      cross-sectional study used data from 769 adults from the Places and Locations for 
      Activity and Nutrition study (ProjectPLAN) conducted in Melbourne and Adelaide, 
      Australia, between 2018 and 2019. Outcomes were 1) visit frequency to i) cafés, ii) 
      restaurants, bars or bistros, iii) major chain fast food outlets and iv) takeaway 
      outlets to purchase food; 2) total number of different types of out-of-home food 
      outlets visited; 3) use frequency of home food delivery services; 4) distance from 
      home to the most frequented out-of-home food outlets. Exposure was whether 
      participants had a 20MN (areas with high service/amenity provision) or a non-20MN 
      (areas with low service/amenity provision). Ordinal regression models were fitted 
      for the frequency outcomes. Poisson regression models were fitted for the number of 
      different outlet types. Linear and spatial regression models were fitted for the 
      distance outcomes. RESULTS: Results suggested no differences in frequency of 
      visitations to out-of-home food outlets and use of food delivery services between 
      those with a 20MN and those with a non-20MN. Yet, those with a 20MN were more likely 
      to use a greater number of different types of outlets on a weekly basis. Where a 
      regular eating out location was reported, it was nearer to home for those with a 
      20MN. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence supportive of 20MNs potentially 
      facilitating more localised food practices, however, 20MNs may also encourage 
      greater cumulative frequency of meals out across a variety of out-of-home food 
      providers.

TI  - Combining Farmers' Preferences With Evidence-Based Strategies to Prevent and Lower 
      Farmers' Distress: Co-design and Acceptability Testing of ifarmwell.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Farming is physically and psychologically hazardous. Farmers face many 
      barriers to help seeking from traditional physical and mental health services; 
      however, improved internet access now provides promising avenues for offering 
      support. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to co-design with farmers the content and 
      functionality of a website that helps them adopt transferable coping strategies and 
      test its acceptability in the broader farming population. METHODS: Research evidence 
      and expert opinions were synthesized to inform key design principles. A total of 18 
      farmers detailed what they would like from this type of website. Intervention logic 
      and relevant evidence-based strategies were mapped. Website content was drafted and 
      reviewed by 2 independent mental health professionals. A total of 9 farmers provided 
      detailed qualitative feedback on the face validity of the draft content. 
      Subsequently, 9 farmers provided feedback on the website prototype. Following 
      amendments and internal prototype testing and optimization, prototype usability (ie, 
      completion rate) was examined with 157 registered website users who were (105/157, 
      66.9%) female, aged 21-73 years; 95.5% (149/156) residing in inner regional to very 
      remote Australia, and 68.2% (107/157) "sheep, cattle and/or grain farmers." 
      Acceptability was examined with a subset of 114 users who rated at least module 1. 
      Interviews with 108 farmers who did not complete all 5 modules helped determine why, 
      and detailed interviews were conducted with 18 purposively sampled users. Updates 
      were then made according to adaptive trial design methodology. RESULTS: This 
      systematic co-design process resulted in a web-based resource based on acceptance 
      and commitment therapy and designed to overcome barriers to engagement with 
      traditional mental health and well-being strategies-ifarmwell. It was considered an 
      accessible and confidential source of practical and relevant farmer-focused 
      self-help strategies. These strategies were delivered via 5 interactive modules that 
      include written, drawn, and audio- and video-based psychoeducation and exercises, as 
      well as farming-related jokes, metaphors, examples, and imagery. Module 1 included 
      distress screening and information on how to speak to general practitioners about 
      mental health-related concerns (including a personalized conversation script). 
      Modules were completed fortnightly. SMS text messages offered personalized support 
      and reminders. Qualitative interviews and star ratings demonstrated high module 
      acceptability (average 4.06/5 rating) and suggested that additional reminders, 
      higher quality audio recordings, and shorter modules would be useful. Approximately 
      37.1% (52/140) of users who started module 1 completed all modules, with too busy or 
      not got to it yet being the main reason for non-completion, and previous module 
      acceptability not predicting subsequent module completion. CONCLUSIONS: Sequential 
      integration of research evidence, expert knowledge, and farmers' preferences in the 
      co-design process allowed for the development of a self-help intervention that 
      focused on important intervention targets and was acceptable to this 
      difficult-to-engage group. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical

TI  - Do resistance exercises during biofeedback therapy enhance the anal sphincter and 
      pelvic floor muscles in anal incontinence?
PG  - e14212
LID - 10.1111/nmo.14212 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To determine if a biofeedback therapy that includes concentric resistance 
      exercise for the anal sphincter muscles can improve muscle strength/function and 
      improve AI symptoms compared to the traditional/non-resistance biofeedback therapy. 
      BACKGROUND: Biofeedback therapy is the current gold standard treatment for patients 
      with anal incontinence (AI). Lack of resistance exercise biofeedback programs is a 
      limitation in current practice. METHODS: Thirty-three women with AI (mean age 
      60 years) were randomly assigned to concentric (resistance) or isometric 
      (non-resistance) biofeedback training. Concentric training utilized the Functional 
      Luminal Imaging Probe to provide progressive resistance exercises based on the 
      patient's ability to collapse the anal canal lumen. Isometric training utilized a 
      non-collapsible 10 mm diameter probe. Both groups performed a biofeedback protocol 
      once per week in the clinic for 12 weeks and at home daily. High definition anal 
      manometry was used to assess anal sphincter strength; symptoms were measured using 
      FISI and UDI-6. 3D transperineal ultrasound imaging was used to assess the anal 
      sphincter muscle integrity. RESULTS: Concentric and isometric groups improved FISI 
      and UDI-6 scores to a similar degree. Both the concentric and isometric groups 
      showed small improvement in the anal high-pressure zone; however, there was no 
      difference between the two groups. Ultrasound image analysis revealed significant 
      damage to the anal sphincter muscles in both patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: Concentric 
      resistance biofeedback training did not improve the anal sphincter muscle function 
      or AI symptoms beyond traditional biofeedback training. Anal sphincter muscle damage 
      may be an important factor that limits the success of biofeedback training.

TI  - The Reliability of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation-Derived Corticomotor Inhibition 
      as a Brain Health Evaluation Tool in Soccer Players.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/s40798-021-00399-3 [doi]
LID - 7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The suitability of corticomotor inhibition and corticospinal 
      excitability to measure brain health outcomes and recovery of sport-related head 
      impact (concussion and subconcussion) depends on good inter-day reliability, which 
      is evaluated in this study. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) reliability in 
      soccer players is assessed by comparing soccer players, for whom reliability on this 
      measure may be reduced due to exposure to head impacts, to generally active 
      individuals not engaged in contact sport. METHODS: TMS-derived corticomotor 
      inhibition and corticospinal excitability were recorded from the rectus femoris 
      muscle during two testing sessions, spaced 1-2 weeks apart in 19 soccer players 
      (SOC-age 22 ± 3 years) and 20 generally active (CON-age 24 ± 4 years) healthy 
      volunteers. Inter-day reliability between the two time points was quantified by 
      using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). Intra-group reliability and group 
      differences on actual measurement values were also explored. RESULTS: Good inter-day 
      reliability was evident for corticomotor inhibition (ICC(SOC) = 0.61; 
      ICC(CON) = 0.70) and corticospinal excitability (ICC(SOC) = 0.59; ICC(CON) = 0.70) 
      in both generally active individuals and soccer players routinely exposed to 
      sport-related head impacts. Corticomotor inhibition showed lower coefficients of 
      variation than excitability for both groups (Inhib(SOC) = 15.2%; Inhib(CON) = 9.7%; 
      Excitab(SOC) = 41.6%; Excitab(CON) = 39.5%). No group differences between soccer 
      players and generally active individuals were found on the corticomotor inhibition 
      value (p > 0.05), but levels of corticospinal excitability were significantly lower 
      in soccer players (45.1 ± 20.8 vs 85.4 ± 6.2%Mmax, p < 0.0001). Corticomotor 
      inhibition also showed excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Corticomotor inhibition and corticospinal excitability are stable and maintain good 
      degrees of reliability when assessed over different days in soccer players, despite 
      their routine exposure to head impacts. However, based on intra-group reliability 
      and group differences of the levels of excitability, we conclude that corticomotor 
      inhibition is best suited for the evaluation of neuromuscular alterations associated 
      with head impacts in contact sports.

TI  - The influence of body composition on the six-minute walk test in Chilean preschool 
      and school children.
PG  - 27-32
LID - 10.20960/nh.03424 [doi]
AB  - Background: the six minutes' walk test (6MWT) measures submaximal physical activity. 
      Objective: this study determines the association of children´s nutritional status 
      and body composition with the results of the 6MWT. Methods: a sample of 1419 Chilean 
      children, 4 to 10 years of age, were assessed including anthropometry, body 
      composition by validated equations, the 6MWT test, and in 50 % of the sample heart 
      rate prior the test, at one minute into the test, and at one minute posttest with a 
      Polar watch. Results: the distance walked ranged from 473.1 ± 47.8 meters in 
      preschool children to 584.2 ± 65.7 meters in school children. In heart rate there 
      was a significant difference between obese and eutrophic children. The distance 
      walked in the 6MWT was positively associated with fat-free mass (p < 0.05) and BMI 
      (R2 = 0.49). Body composition influences 6MWT quartile distribution, as well as 
      nutritional status. Age and height explained 49 % of the variance (R2 = 0.42 and 
      0.47, respectively) in the 6MWT, and there are significant differences in this 
      variable by sex, body composition, and nutritional status. Conclusions: body 
      composition was associated with walking performance in children. Thus, it is 
      important to evaluate height and body composition when assessing the six-minute walk 
      test because of this important relationship.

TI  - Runner's Health Choices Questionnaire: Male College Cross-Country Runners' 
      Perspectives on Health and Eating.
PG  - 181–190
LID - jsr.2021-0082 [pii]
LID - 10.1123/jsr.2021-0082 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Competitive cross-country runners train at much higher loads and with 
      greater demands than recreational runners, posing a unique set of physiological and 
      psychological challenges. Thus, identification of factors influencing health and 
      nutritional choices in male cross-country runners is needed to help combat 
      energy-related health issues. PURPOSE: To assess male college cross-country runners' 
      perspectives regarding sport-related health and the factors impacting their eating 
      behaviors. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. PARTICIPANTS/METHODS: The Runner's Health 
      Choices Questionnaire was distributed to male college cross-country runners. 
      Responses were analyzed using quantitative descriptive statistics. RESULTS: One 
      hundred nineteen runners completed the survey. Runners reported a diverse range of 
      factors impacting eating and health behaviors from athletic performance enhancement 
      to enjoyment of food. Less than 6% of athletes ranked athletic trainer, registered 
      dietitian, or physician as often consulted for nutrition/health information. 
      However, 75% of runners said they would be somewhat likely or very likely to make 
      dietary or health changes if given new or additional information by a health care 
      provider. CONCLUSION: Male cross-country runners appear to try to balance a global 
      desire to be healthy with individual preferences. Athletes may be receptive to 
      nutritional education that utilizes a biopsychosocial model with mental and 
      psychological health support, and intentional effort is needed to support runners' 
      overall health.

TI  - Associations between weight loss history and factors related to type 2 diabetes risk 
      in the Stop Diabetes study.
LID - 10.1038/s41366-021-01061-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frequent weight loss attempts are related to maladaptive eating 
      behaviours and higher body mass index (BMI). We studied associations of several type 
      2 diabetes (T2D) risk factors with weight loss history, defined as the frequency of 
      prior weight loss attempts, among Finnish adults at increased risk for T2D. METHODS: 
      This study (n = 2684, 80% women) is a secondary analysis of the 1-year StopDia 
      lifestyle intervention with digital intervention group, digital 
      intervention + face-to-face counselling group, or control group. The frequency of 
      prior weight loss attempts was categorized into five groups: no attempts/no attempts 
      to lose weight, but trying to keep weight stable/1-2 attempts/3 or more attempts/ 
      continuous attempts. Data on emotional eating and social/emotional nutrition 
      self-efficacy were collected with a digital questionnaire. We assessed baseline 
      differences between categories of weight loss history as well as the intervention 
      effects. RESULTS: Altogether 84% of participants had attempted weight loss. Those 
      with one or more weight loss attempts had higher BMI, larger waist circumference, 
      and more emotional eating compared to 'no attempts' and 'no attempts to lose weight, 
      but trying to keep weight stable' categories. The 'no attempts' category had the 
      highest baseline fasting insulin, whereas it showed the largest decrease in this 
      measure with the intervention. This change in fasting insulin in the 'no attempts' 
      category was significantly different from all the other categories. Emotional 
      nutrition self-efficacy slightly improved in the 'no attempts' category, which was 
      significantly different from its concomitant decrease in the categories '1-2 
      attempts' and '3 or more attempts'. The intervention group assignment did not affect 
      the results. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple attempts to lose weight may unfavourably affect 
      T2D risk factors as well as lifestyle intervention outcomes. More research is needed 
      on how weight loss frequency could affect T2D risk factors and how to design 
      lifestyle interventions for individuals with frequent previous weight loss attempts.

      Cross-Sectional Study.

LID - 1711
AB  - Social determinants of health are a major contributing factor to health inequalities 
      and have important effects on the health of the population. The aim of the study was 
      to estimate the prevalence of overweight/obesity in native and immigrant children 
      aged 2-14 years residing in Spain, and to explore its relationship with 
      socioeconomic factors, habits, and living and health conditions. This study used 
      data from the 2017 Spanish National Health Survey, which collects health information 
      on the population residing in Spain. Multivariate logistic regression models were 
      fitted to estimate the risk of overweight/obesity controlling for the variables of 
      interest. The final sample consisted of 2351 households. Children of immigrant 
      origin had a significantly higher overall prevalence of overweight and/or obesity 
      than natives, both in boys (40.5% vs. 29.5%) and girls (44.8% vs. 30.3%), and a 
      higher adjusted risk of overweight/obesity (OR = 1.67). In addition, it has been 
      observed that children of immigrant origin were at higher risk of consuming sugary 
      soft drinks, exercising less, and using screens more. In conclusion, the increased 
      risk of having different habits that may contribute to developing excess weight and 
      of having overweight/obesity in children with a migrant background should guide 
      public health policies and interventions, emphasizing those groups at higher risk 
      and incorporating considerations of socioeconomic inequalities.

TI  - Effects of 12 Months Consumption of 100 g Dried Plum (Prunes) on Bone Biomarkers, 
      Density, and Strength in Men.
PG  - 40-47

AB  - Several male animal studies have demonstrated bone-protective effects of dried plum; 
      however, no human male study has evaluated the effect of dried plum on bone health. 
      We conducted a randomized controlled clinical study to test if daily inclusion of 
      100 g of dried plum in the diet positively influenced bone mineral density (BMD), 
      bone strength, and bone biomarkers in men. Sixty-six men were randomly assigned to 
      one of two daily treatment groups: (1) control (0 g dried plum) or (2) 100 g dried 
      plum. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 months to 
      assess bone biomarkers. Bone was measured at baseline and after 6 and 12 months via 
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and peripheral quantitative computed tomography. 
      Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b (TRAP5b) and C-terminal collagen cross-link 
      (CTX) levels decreased significantly in the dried plum group at 3-, 6-, and 12-month 
      intervals compared with baseline. No changes were observed in the control group for 
      TRAP5b and CTX levels. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels decreased 
      significantly after 6 and 12 months in the control and dried plum groups. BMD for 
      total body, spine (L1-L4), hip, and ulna did not change in the control and dried 
      plum groups from baseline to 6 or 12 months. In the proximal tibia, endosteal 
      circumferences increased significantly within the dried plum group during the course 
      of treatment. The results suggest that daily consumption of 100 g dried plum for 12 
      months has modest bone-protective effects in men. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cross-sectional and prospective associations of 
      lifestyle risk behaviors clustering with elevated depressive symptoms and to explore 
      synergic prospective associations of different combinations of lifestyle risk 
      behaviors with subsequent depressive symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort 
      study. Data on 31,190 middle-aged and older adults from waves 4 (2011) and 6 (2015) 
      of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) were used. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Elevated depressive symptoms were estimated using the EURO-D 
      12-item scale. Lifestyle risk behaviors composing the cluster included physical 
      inactivity, inadequate consumption of fruit and/or vegetables, binge drinking, and 
      tobacco smoking. Gender, age group, education, place of residence, country, number 
      of chronic diseases and body mass index were considered as confounders. RESULTS: 
      With the exception of binge drinking, all lifestyle risk behaviors were associated 
      with higher odds of elevated depressive symptoms in cross-sectional and prospective 
      analyses. The clustering of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors was cross-sectionally 
      associated with elevated depressive symptoms and the clustering of two [odds ratio 
      [OR]: 1.39; 95%CI: 1.28-1.51) and three or four (OR: 1.60; 95%CI: 1.38-1.85) were 
      prospectively associated with elevated depressive symptoms. There were no 
      interactions between the pairs of behaviors in the association with later elevated 
      depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the need for interventions 
      integrating multiple health behaviors to prevent elevated depressive symptoms among 
      middle-aged and older adults.

TI  - Effects of continuous cycling training on motor unit firing rates, input excitation, 
      and myosin heavy chain of the vastus lateralis in sedentary females.
LID - 10.1007/s00221-021-06278-3 [doi]
AB  - This study examined the effects of continuous endurance training on motor unit (MU) 
      mean firing rates (MFR), percent myosin heavy chain (%MHC) isoforms, and muscle 
      cross-sectional area (mCSA) of the vastus lateralis (VL). Twelve females completed 
      5-weeks of continuous cycling-training (CYC), while 8 females were controls (CON). 
      Participants performed maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) and 40% MVCs of the 
      knee extensors before (PRE) and after the 5-week treatment period at the same 
      absolute pre-treatment submaximal torque (POST(ABS)) and relative to post-treatment 
      MVCs (POST(REL)). Surface electromyographic (EMG) signals were decomposed with the 
      Precision Decomposition III algorithm. MU firing times and waveforms were validated 
      with reconstruct-and-test and spike trigger average procedures. MFRs at steady 
      torque, recruitment thresholds (RT), and normalized EMG amplitude (N-EMG(RMS)) were 
      analyzed. Y-intercepts and slopes were calculated for the MFR vs. RT relationships. 
      MHC isoforms and mCSA were determined with muscle biopsies and ultrasonography. CYC 
      decreased MVCs and type IIX %MHC isoform without changes in mCSA. The slopes for the 
      MFR vs. RT relationships decreased for CYC during POST(REL) and POST(ABS) while 
      N-EMG(RMS) increased for POST(ABS) with no differences between PRE and POST(REL). 
      Type I %MHC isoform was correlated with the slope for the MFR vs. RT relationship 
      during POST(ABS) and POST(REL) for CYC. This study provides evidence that decreases 
      in the MFRs of higher threshold MUs post-CYC is likely a function of changes in 
      input excitation (POST(ABS)) and the firing frequency-excitation relationships 
      (POST(REL)). Evidence is provided that MHC isoforms influence the firing rate scheme 
      of the muscle following short-term training.

TI  - Effect of severe versus moderate energy restriction on physical activity among 
      postmenopausal female adults with obesity: a pre-specified secondary analysis of the 
      TEMPO Diet randomized controlled Trial.
LID - nqac024 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/nqac024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: An under-explored strategy for increasing physical activity is the 
      dietary treatment of obesity, but empirical evidence is lacking. OBJECTIVES: To 
      compare the effects of weight loss via severe versus moderate energy restriction on 
      physical activity over 36 months. METHODS: 101 postmenopausal female adults (45-65 
      years, 30-40 kg/m2, <180 minutes per week of structured exercise) were randomized to 
      either 12 months of moderate energy restriction (25-35% of energy requirement) with 
      a food-based diet, or a severe intervention involving 4 months of severe energy 
      restriction (65-75% of energy requirement) with a total meal replacement diet, 
      followed by 8 months of moderate energy restriction. Physical activity was 
      encouraged, but no tailored or supervised exercise prescription was provided. 
      Physical activity was assessed with an accelerometer worn for 7 days prior to 
      baseline (0 months) and 0.25, 1, 4, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after intervention 
      commencement. RESULTS: Compared to the moderate group, the severe group exhibited 
      greater mean levels of: total volume of physical activity; duration of 
      moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA); duration of light-intensity 
      physical activity; and step counts, as well as lower mean duration of sedentary 
      time. All these differences (except step counts) were apparent at 6 months (e.g., 
      1006 [95% confidence interval 564, 1449] MET-minutes per week for total volume of 
      physical activity), and some were also apparent at 4 and/or 12 months. There were no 
      differences between groups in the two other outcomes investigated (self-efficacy to 
      regulate exercise; and proportion of participants meeting the World Health 
      Organization's 2020 Physical Activity Guidelines for MVPA). When the analyses were 
      adjusted for weight at each time point, the differences between groups were either 
      attenuated or abolished. CONCLUSIONS: Among female adults with obesity, including a 
      dietary component to reduce excess body weight-notably one involving severe energy 
      restriction-could potentially enhance the effectiveness of physical activity 
      interventions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Short periods of excessive consumption of indulgent high-fat foods are 
      common in Western society, but the effect this has on bone is unknown. The aim of 
      this pilot study was to explore how a 7-d hyperenergetic, high-fat diet affects 
      candidate biomarkers of bone metabolism. METHODS: The study included 12 healthy men 
      with a mean age of 24 y (SD = 4 y) and body mass index (BMI) of 24.1 kg/m(2) 
      (SD = 1.5). The men consumed a 7-d hyperenergetic, high-fat diet (HE-HFD; 20.9 
      [SD = 0.8] MJ; 65% total energy as fat) and a control (CON) diet (10.9 [SD = 2] MJ; 
      36% total energy as fat), in randomized, crossover order, with each trial separated 
      by 3 wk. Markers of bone formation (P1NP) and bone resorption (CTx) were measured at 
      baseline and after 1, 3, and 7 d of each diet. Bone metabolic responses were 
      analyzed using two-factor repeated-measures analysis of variance and subsequent 
      pairwise comparisons. RESULTS: There was a main effect of time (P < 0.05), but no 
      trial (P = 0.270) or time- × -trial interaction (P = 0.693) effects for plasma 
      concentrations of CTx. Mean CTx concentrations did not differ between trials (CON: 
      0.97 ng/mL [SD = 0.39]; HE-HFD: 1.03 ng/mL [SD = 0.22]; P = 0.225). There was a main 
      effect of trial (P < 0.01), but no time (P = 0.138) or trial- × -interaction 
      (P = 0.179) effects for plasma concentrations of P1NP. Mean P1NP concentrations were 
      lower during the HE-HFD (61.79 ng/mL [SD = 26.54]) than during the CON diet (77.89 
      ng/mL [SD = 28.71]; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: A 7-d hyperenergetic, high-fat diet 
      reduces a marker of bone formation but does not affect a marker of bone resorption. 
      This pilot study suggested that short periods of excessive energy and fat 
      consumption may detrimentally affect bone health.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effects of the health promotion intervention 
      "11 for Health in Denmark" program on 10- to 12-year-old ethnic minority 
      schoolchildren's enjoyment, health knowledge, well-being, and fitness. METHODS: 
      1122 Danish 5th grade schoolchildren with ethnic minority background from 
      154 schools were randomized (5:1) to an intervention group (IG, n = 944) or a 
      control group (CG, n = 178). The IG and CG were also divided into subgroups of 
      children active in a sports club (IGPA: n = 644; CGPA: n = 122) and not active in a 
      sports club (IGPI: n = 300, CGPI: n = 56). IG participated in the "11 for Health in 
      Denmark" 11-week program, consisting of 2 × 45 min per week of football drills, 
      small-sided games, and health education, whereas CG continued their regular 
      activities. Pre-post physical testing and questionnaires were applied (short version 
      of the multidimensional well-being questionnaire KIDSCREEN-27, and a 34-item health 
      knowledge questionnaire). RESULTS: The "11 for Health in Denmark" program was rated 
      moderate-to-high on a 1-5 scale for enjoyment by girls (3.57) and boys (3.65). The 
      intervention had positive between-group effect on health knowledge in relation to 
      hygiene (IG vs GC: 10.6% points (CI95%: 6.9:14.3), p < 0.05), nutrition (9.6% point 
      (CI95%: 7.4:11.8), p < 0.01) and physical activity 4.4% points (CI95%: 2.2:6.6) as 
      well as overall health knowledge (5.7% points, (CI95%: 4.3;7.1), p < 0.05), with 
      similar effects for girls and boys. The IGPI subgroup showed a positive effect on 
      well-being (p = 0.04, school and learning) and also fitness effects on performance 
      and VO(2)  max (p = 0.02: p = 0.01). The IGPA subgroup showed a positive effect on 
      fitness scores (p = 0.02, BMI). CONCLUSION: The intervention program was enjoyable 
      and had a positive impact on health knowledge of ethnic minority background 
      schoolchildren. In addition, the intervention program had the strongest positive 
      effects on well-being and fitness scores for the non-sports club-active children.

AB  - Health researchers have long acknowledged the limitations of self-reporting in 
      studies of health in the home and have consequently sought various methods to 
      broaden research beyond self-reporting in efficient and productive ways. Our two 
      independent research studies, one in Copenhagen, Denmark (2015), and one in 
      Providence County, Rhode Island, in the United States (2015-2016), illustrate how 
      health researchers can adapt an everyday material culture approach used in 
      anthropology to fit the needs of health and wellbeing studies, particularly when it 
      comes to home-based research on health behavior. Our two studies both utilized one 
      particular household object-the refrigerator-to help explore everyday eating habits 
      in various types of households. By analyzing these separate studies together, we 
      found that using the refrigerator in object-elicitation exercises and photographing 
      the refrigerator provided insights that enhanced the interview process, thereby 
      efficiently addressing some of the limitations of interviews and self-reporting. We 
      also found that the refrigerator was a useful comparative tool both within our 
      individual studies and across our research contexts. We conclude that the 
      refrigerator and other everyday use objects are useful methodological tools in 
      health-related studies in the home, and propose that regularly utilizing the 
      refrigerator may help researchers interpret qualitative data about nutrition and 
      eating habits.

AB  - Dexamethasone (Dexa) is a potent glucocorticoid that can trigger side effects, such 
      as neuromuscular, cardiovascular, and gastric motility disorders. Exercise can 
      ameliorate gastrointestinal disorders. However, it is not clear whether exercise can 
      modulate the side effects of using Dexa on gastric motility. To investigate the role 
      of anaerobic resistance training (ART) on gastric motility and feeding behavior of 
      rats treated with dexamethasone, rats were divided into three groups: control 
      (Ctrl), dexamethasone (Dexa), and anaerobic resistance training + dexamethasone 
      (ARTDexa). Anaerobic resistance training (ART) consisted of climbing a vertical 
      ladder 5 days/week (with intensity of 50% to 100% of the maximum overload/8 weeks). 
      At the end of the ART or control period, the rats received Dexa (1 mg/kg i.p) for 10 
      consecutive days. In the end, we evaluated anthropometric parameters and feeding 
      behavior, heart rate, gastric emptying, and lipid profile in all groups. We observed 
      significant decrease (p < 0.05) in body weight and food intake in the Dexa and 
      ARTDexa groups compared to the control. Dexa promoted significant tachycardia 
      (p < 0.05) and a decrease (p < 0.05) in the r-r' interval. The ART significantly 
      prevented (p < 0.05) cardiovascular effects. Dexa induced a decrease (p < 0.05) in 
      gastric emptying compared to the control group. On the other hand, ART significantly 
      prevented (p < 0.05) the decrease in gastric emptying compared to Dexa. The chronic 
      use of Dexa caused tachycardia, decreased food intake, and decreased gastric 
      emptying. The ART modulated cardiovascular parameters, improving tachycardia. In 
      addition, this exercise prevented gastric dysmotility induced by dexamethasone.

TI  - Time Trends in Physical Activity Using Wearable Devices: A Systematic Review and 
      Meta-analysis of Studies from 1995 to 2017.
PG  - 288-298
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000002794 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Conflicting evidence exists on whether physical activity (PA) levels 
      of humans have changed over the last quarter-century. The main objective of this 
      study was to determine if there is evidence of time trends in PA, from 
      cross-sectional studies that assessed PA at different time points using wearable 
      devices (e.g., pedometers and accelerometers). A secondary objective was to quantify 
      the rate of change in PA. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted of 
      English-language studies indexed in PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science 
      (1960-2020) using search terms (time OR temporal OR secular) AND trends AND (steps 
      per day OR pedometer OR accelerometer OR MVPA). Subsequently, a meta-analytic 
      approach was used to aggregate data from multiple studies and to examine specific 
      factors (i.e., sex, age-group, sex and age-group, and PA metric). RESULTS: Based on 
      16 peer-reviewed scientific studies conducted between 1995 and 2017, levels of 
      ambulatory PA are trending downward in developed countries. Significant declines 
      were seen in both males and females (P < 0.001) as well as in children (P = 0.020), 
      adolescents (P < 0.001), and adults (P = 0.004). The average study duration was 9.4 
      yr (accelerometer studies, 5.3 yr; pedometer studies, 10.8 yr). For studies that 
      assessed steps, the average change in PA was -1118 steps per day over the course of 
      the study (P < 0.001), and adolescents had the greatest change in PA at -2278 steps 
      per day (P < 0.001). Adolescents also had the steepest rate of change over time, 
      expressed in steps per day per decade. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from studies conducted 
      in eight developed nations over a 22-yr period indicates that PA levels have 
      declined overall, especially in adolescents. This study emphasizes the need for 
      continued research tracking time trends in PA using wearable devices.

TI  - COVID-19-Related Life Experiences, Outdoor Play, and Long-term Adiposity Changes 
      Among Preschool- and School-Aged Children in Singapore 1 Year After Lockdown.
LID - 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.5585 [doi]
LID - e215585
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Despite the potential for COVID-19 infection control-related events to 
      have an effect on child well-being, comprehensive assessments of postlockdown 
      changes and persistent outcomes are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To survey the extent of 
      COVID-19 lockdown-related lifestyle changes, their differences by child age and 
      family socioeconomic status, and the potential association with child adiposity 1 
      year after lockdown. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A self-administered, 
      electronic survey was introduced to 2 ongoing child cohorts (the Singapore 
      Preconception Study of Long-term Maternal and Child Outcomes [S-PRESTO] cohort of 
      preschool children aged 1-4.5 years and the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy 
      Outcomes [GUSTO] cohort of primary school children aged 9-10.7 years) from July 8, 
      2020, to September 5, 2020, which was 1 to 3 months after the end of strict 
      universal movement restrictions (duration of 73 days ending on June 19, 2020). All 
      active participants from S-PRESTO and GUSTO, 2 population-based, longitudinal, 
      parent-offspring cohorts in Singapore, were invited to participate and monitored 
      through June 15, 2021. EXPOSURES: Exposures included family income before and after 
      the COVID-19 lockdown, changes in child outdoor play or exercise, and 
      COVID-19-related life events; all data were self-reported by parents and school-aged 
      children 1 to 3 months after the lockdown. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary 
      outcomes were self-reported COVID-19-related life events and changes in child online 
      socialization, outdoor play or exercise, and intrafamily relationships. Study staff 
      measured children's weight, height, and skinfold thickness before and up to 1 year 
      after lockdown. Body mass indices (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by 
      height in meters squared) and World Health Organization-standardized scores were 
      computed. Differences before and after lockdown were compared using 
      baseline-adjusted linear regression. RESULTS: A total of 604 parents (53% of active 
      cohort participants) and 356 school-aged children completed the survey and were 
      similar to source cohorts. This represents 373 of 761 eligible children in the GUSTO 
      cohort (mean [SD] age, 9.9 [0.4] years; 197 girls [52.8%]) and 231 of 370 eligible 
      children in the S-PRESTO cohort (mean [SD] age, 2.6 [0.8] years; 121 boys [52.6%]). 
      The COVID-19-related life changes were prevalent and varied (eg, 414 of 600 children 
      [69.0%] reported changes in social activities). More than one-third of primary 
      school-aged children (122 of 356 [34.3%]) and one-quarter of preschool-aged children 
      (56 of 229 [24.5%]) eliminated any outdoor play after the lockdown. Lower family 
      income before the lockdown was associated with increased odds of elimination of 
      outdoor play (adjusted odds ratio per 1000 Singapore dollars [$730 US dollars] 
      decrease, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.19). Complete elimination of outdoor activity (vs 
      continued outdoor activity) was associated with an increase in body mass index of 
      0.48 (95% CI, 0.03-0.94) and a body mass index z score of 0.18 units (95% CI, 
      0-0.37) in school-aged children approximately 1 year after lockdown. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      RELEVANCE: Results of this cohort study suggest that 1 to 3 months after a brief, 
      strict lockdown, a large proportion of parents and school-aged children reported 
      elimination of outdoor play, which was more prevalent in lower-income families. 
      Future research to better understand clinical implications and ways to mitigate 
      lockdown outcomes is essential.

TI  - The Effects of 10-Day Exogenous Ketone Consumption on Repeated Time Trial Running 
      Performances: A Randomized-Control Trial.
PG  - 34-48
LID - 10.1080/19390211.2020.1838022 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The effects of ketone salt supplementation on repeated short-distance 
      running time trial (TT) performance in well-trained subjects remain unknown. 
      PURPOSE: To determine the effects of 10-day exogenous ketone salt supplementation on 
      two consecutive 800 m running TTs in endurance-trained subjects. METHODS: Male and 
      female subjects were randomly allocated to one of the following groups: Ketone (KET) 
      (n = 16) or placebo (CON) (n = 16) (8 m, 8f per group). Subjects underwent two 
      consecutive 800 m TTs before and after a 10-day treatment on a self-propelled 
      treadmill. Time-to-completion of the first (TT1) and second (TT2) TT, the average 
      time-to-completion (TT(AVG)), and blood lactate response during each TT was measured 
      pre-post-treatment. Changes in blood ketone levels in response to a single dosing 
      were measured pre- and post-treatment. Data was analyzed with a mixed factorial 
      ANOVA with significance set to p < 0.05. RESULTS: KET demonstrated a faster TT(AVG) 
      from pre- to post-treatment (-6.1 ± 8.9 s; p = 0.02) while CON showed no change. At 
      pre- and post-treatment, CON showed no acute changes in blood ketones after a 
      single-dosing while KET demonstrated a significant increases 
      (Pretreatment = +0.4 ± 0.3 mmol/L; p < 0.001; Post-Treatment = +0.4 ± 0.4 mmol/L; 
      p < 0.001). These acute single-dosing responses in blood ketone levels for KET did 
      not change between pre- and post-treatment. There were no interactions for blood 
      lactate response to exercise or fatigue index. CONCLUSIONS: In trained subjects, 
      10 days of ketone salt supplementation does not affect performance in an initial 
      bout of short-distance running, such as during TT1. However, ergogenic effects may 
      be observed under fatigue conditions for example during a repeated running bout.

TI  - Early mobilisation in critically ill children: Does routine patient screening reduce 
      time to commencing mobilisation?
LID - S1036-7314(21)00181-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.aucc.2021.12.007 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of daily 
      screening for medical readiness to participate in early mobilisation in the 
      paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), on reducing time to mobilisation and to 
      explore the safety-, feasibility-, and patient-level barriers to the practice. 
      METHODS: An interventional study with a historical control group was conducted in a 
      PICU in a tertiary teaching hospital in Australia. The Early Mobilisation Screening 
      Checklist was applied at 24-48 h of PICU stay with the aim to reduce time to 
      commencing mobilisation. All patients aged term to 18 years admitted to the PICU for 
      >48 h were included in this study. Data on time to mobilisation and patient 
      characteristics were collected by an unblinded case note audit of children admitted 
      to the PICU over 5 months in 2018 for the baseline group and over a corresponding 
      period in 2019 for the intervention group. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 
      71 children were enrolled. Survival analysis was used to compare time to 
      mobilisation between groups, and a cox regression model found that children in the 
      intervention group were 1.26 times more likely to participate in mobility, but this 
      was not statistically significant (P = 0.391, log rank test for equality of survival 
      functions). Early mobilisation was safe, with no adverse events reported in 177 
      participant mobilisation days. Feasibility was demonstrated by 62% of participants 
      mobilising within 72 h of admission. Mechanical ventilation during stay (P = 0.043) 
      and days receiving sedation infusion (% of days) (P = 0.042) were associated with a 
      decreased likelihood of participating in mobility. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of 
      routine screening alone does not significantly reduce time to commencing mobility in 
      the PICU. Early mobilisation in the PICU is safe and feasible and resulted in no 
      adverse events during mobilisation. Patient characteristics influencing 
      participation in mobility warrant further exploration.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the accuracy of 3 recently released 
      wrist-worn devices (Apple Watch 6, Polar Vantage V and Fitbit Sense) for heart rate 
      and energy expenditure during various activities. The study population consisted of 
      60 young healthy individuals (30 men and 30 women; age: 24.9 ± 3.0 years, BMI: 
      23.1 ± 2.7 kg/m2). Heart rate and energy expenditure were measured using the Polar 
      H10 and Metamax 3B, respectively (reference measures) as well as with the 3 
      wrist-worn devices during 5 different activities (sitting, walking, running, 
      resistance exercises and cycling). The Apple Watch 6 displayed the highest level of 
      accuracy for heart rate measurement with a coefficient of variation (CV) (%) of less 
      than 5% for all 5 activities, whereas the Polar Vantage V and the Fitbit Sense 
      presented various degrees of accuracy (from high to poor accuracy) dependent on the 
      activity (CVs between 2.44-8.80% and 4.14-10.76%, respectively). As for energy 
      expenditure, all 3 devices displayed poor accuracy for all 5 physical activities 
      (CVs between 14.68-24.85% for Apple Watch 6, 16.54-25.78% for Polar Vantage V and 
      13.44-29.66% for Fitbit Sense). Results of the present study indicate that the Apple 
      Watch 6 was the most accurate for measuring heart rate across all 5 activities, 
      whereas variable levels of accuracy for heart rate measurement for the Polar Vantage 
      V and the Fitbit Sense were observed depending on the activity. As for energy 
      expenditure, all 3 devices showed poor accuracy during all activities.HighlightsThe 
      Apple Watch 6 was the most accurate for measuring heart rate, whereas the Polar 
      Vantage V and Fitbit Sense showed variable results dependent on the activityThe 
      Apple Watch 6, Polar Vantage V and Fitbit Sense showed poor accuracy for energy 
      expenditure during 5 different physical activitiesHealthcare care professionals, 
      athletes/coaches and the general population may want to proceed with caution on the 
      clinical utility of energy expenditure of these devices during the implementation of 
      an exercise training or nutritional programme.

TI  - Dietary supplements intake during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic: A 
      multinational Middle Eastern study.
PG  - 102102
LID - 10.1016/j.eujim.2022.102102 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite the controversy about the benefits of dietary supplements in 
      treating or preventing COVID-19, their use has increased worldwide even with the 
      introduction of relevant vaccines. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the 
      perception of the Middle Eastern Arab public of dietary supplements as prophylactic 
      or therapeutic agents against COVID-19, and their consumption during the second wave 
      of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A validated, pilot tested online survey was 
      distributed through social networking platforms in Lebanon, the Kingdom of Saudi 
      Arabia, Palestine, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates. Responses underwent various 
      statistical analyses. RESULTS: A total of 2,100 responses were included. Around 44% 
      of participants reported changes in their dietary behavior during COVID-19, and 70% 
      believed that healthy habits may prevent the infection. Moreover, 21% believed that 
      dietary supplements surely protect against COVID-19 and 45% thought they aid in 
      treating it. Users of supplements during the second wave of the pandemic counted for 
      47%, who declared they were influenced by the media, healthcare providers, or close 
      contacts. The most used supplements included Vitamins C and D and zinc. Only 34% of 
      participants read supplement leaflets. The use of supplements was significantly 
      correlated with being female and exercising, as revealed by the odds ratio and 
      logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In line with other areas of the world, 
      the use of dietary supplements in the Middle East against COVID-19 is not 
      evidence-based. Competent health authorities should play their role in spreading 
      sound awareness among the public regarding this issue.

TI  - The influence of a basic military training diet on whole blood fatty acid profile 
      and the Omega-3 Index of Australian Army recruits.
PG  - 151-158
LID - 10.1139/apnm-2021-0459 [doi]
AB  - This study described the whole blood fatty acid profile and Omega-3 Index (O3I) of 
      Australian Army recruits at the commencement and completion of basic military 
      training (BMT). Eighty males (17-34 y, 77.4 ± 13.0 kg, 43.5 ± 4.3 mL/kg/min) and 37 
      females (17-45 y, 64.3 ± 8.8 kg, 39.3 ± 2.7 mL/kg/min) volunteered to participate 
      (N = 117). Whole blood samples of each recruit were collected using a finger prick 
      in weeks 1 and 11 (n = 82) and analysed via gas chromatography for the relative 
      proportions of each fatty acid (mean [95% confidence interval]). The macronutrient 
      characteristics of the diet offerings was also determined. At commencement there was 
      a low omega-3 status (sum of omega-3; 4.95% [4.82-5.07]) and O3I (5.03% [4.90-5.16]) 
      and no recruit recorded an O3I >8% (desirable). The omega-6/omega-3 (7.04 
      [6.85-7.23]) and arachidonic acid/eicosapentaenoic acid (AA/EPA) (18.70 
      [17.86-19.53]) ratios for the cohort were also undesirable. The BMT mess menu 
      provided a maximum of 190 mg/day of EPA and 260 mg/day of docosahexaenoic acid 
      (DHA). The O3I of the recruits was lower by week 11 (4.62% [4.51-4.78], p < 0.05), 
      the omega-6/omega-3 increased (7.27 [7.07-7.47], p < 0.05) and the AA/EPA remained 
      elevated (17.85 [16.89-18.81]). In conclusion, Australian Army recruits' omega-3 
      status remained undesirable during BMT and deserves nutritional attention. Novelty: 
      Australian Army recruits' Omega-3 Index, at the commencement of BMT, was reflective 
      of the Western-style diet. The BMT diet offered minimum opportunity for daily EPA 
      and DHA consumption. Every recruit experienced a further reduction of their Omega-3 
      Index during BMT.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study was conducted to determine the effects of group counseling based 
      on the solution-focused approach (SFA) on anxiety and healthy lifestyle behaviors in 
      individuals with eating disorders. DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was implemented 
      with a pretest-posttest experimental (n:31) randomized controlled (n:45) design. 
      Adults aged 25 and older were included in the study. FINDINGS: After the 
      intervention, there was a decrease in the trait anxiety inventory scores, while 
      there was an increase in the healthy lifestyle scores and subscale scores. 
      Additionally, the mean weight of the individuals in the experiment group and their 
      body mass indices decreased, and their weekly hours of exercise increased. PRACTICAL 
      IMPLICATIONS: SFA counseling provided to the individuals with eating disorders 
      decreased the anxiety of the individuals and increased their healthy lifestyle 
      behaviors.

AB  - Parents' feeding practices are associated with children's food intake. However, 
      little is known about the patterns of feeding practices used by groups of mothers or 
      how these groupings of practices influence children's dietary intake. Therefore, the 
      aims of this study are to classify and describe groups of mothers according to their 
      patterns of feeding practices and to examine the associations between the groups of 
      maternal feeding practices and pre-school children's dietary quality. In 2018, 1349 
      mothers based in Australia of children aged 2-5 years completed an online survey 
      including validated measures of nine feeding practices and dietary quality, measured 
      using thirteen summed dietary items. Latent profile analysis was used to identify 
      distinct groups of mothers who shared similar feeding practices. Linear regression 
      models were fitted to examine associations between the feeding practice profiles and 
      child dietary quality. A three-profile model was chosen based on interpretation, 
      profile size and statistical model fit criteria. Profile 1 had lower mean scores of 
      structure-related feeding practices than the other profiles; profile 2 had mean 
      scores reflecting slightly higher use of most structure-related feeding practices 
      and lower mean scores of some non-responsive feeding practices; profile 3 had higher 
      mean scores of non-responsive feeding practices than the other profiles. Profile 1 
      (-2.95, CI: 3.97; -1.92) and profile 3 (-2.81, CI: 3.49; -2.13) had lower mean child 
      dietary quality scores compared with profile 2. Profile 2, which reflected the most 
      engagement in structure-related feeding practices combined with least non-responsive 
      feeding practices, was associated with higher child diet quality, compared with the 
      other two profiles. The identification of these unique profiles could help to tailor 
      future interventions to consider patterns of feeding practices used by groups of 
      mothers.

TI  - Vitamin D biomarkers for Dietary Reference Intake development in children: a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 544-558
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/nqab357 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] has been the accepted vitamin 
      D exposure/intake biomarker of choice within recent DRI exercises, but use of other 
      vitamin D-related biomarkers as well as functional markers has been suggested. These 
      may be of value in future vitamin D DRI exercises, such as the FAO/WHO's one for 
      young children. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the usefulness of circulating 
      25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), free and bioavailable 25(OH)D, C3-epimer of 
      25(OH)D, vitamin D3, 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [24,25(OH)2D], and bone turnover 
      markers and calcium absorption as vitamin D biomarkers for DRI development in 
      children. METHODS: Methods included structured searches of published articles, 
      full-text reviews, data extraction, quality assessment, meta-analysis, and 
      random-effects meta-regression. RESULTS: Fifty-nine vitamin D supplementation 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included (39 in infants/children as the 
      priority group and the remainder in adults since pediatric studies were 
      absent/limited). Vitamin D supplementation significantly raised circulating 25(OH)D 
      in infants and children, but the response was highly heterogeneous [weighted mean 
      difference (WMD): 27.7 nmol/L; 95% CI: 22.9, 32.5; 27 RCTs; I2 = 93%]. 
      Meta-regression suggested an increase by 1.7 nmol/L (95% CI: 0.7, 2.6) in serum 
      25(OH)D per each 100-IU increment in vitamin D intake (P = 0.0005). Vitamin D 
      supplementation had a significant effect on circulating 24,25(OH)2D (WMD: 
      3.4 nmol/L; 95% CI: 2.4, 4.5; 13 RCTs; I2 = 95%), with a dose-response relation 
      (+0.15 nmol/L per 100 IU; 95% CI: -0.01, 0.29). With circulating PTH, although there 
      was a significant effect of vitamin D on WMD (P = 0.05), there was no significant 
      dose-response relation (P = 0.32). Pediatric data were too limited in relation to 
      the usefulness of the other biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating 25(OH)D may be a 
      useful biomarker of vitamin D exposure/intake for DRI development in infants and 
      children. Circulating 24,25(OH)2D also showed some promise, but further data are 
      needed, especially in infants and children.

TI  - Hepatic steatosis is associated with anthropometry, cardio-metabolic disease risk,

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the associations of non-alcoholic fatty liver 
      disease (NAFLD) with cardio-metabolic risk factors for diabetes in adult Kenyans. 
      METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken among rural and urban Kenyans of 
      different ethnic origin. Ultrasonography scanning (USS) methods were used for the 
      assessment of hepatic fat accumulation for NAFLD assessment and abdominal fat 
      distribution, and simple anthropometry measurements were performed. All participants 
      underwent a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test, and biochemical, haemodynamic and 
      lifestyle data were obtained. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to 
      assess sex, age, residency and ethnic differences in the association between NAFLD 
      and various metabolic parameters. RESULTS: In total, 743 individuals (59.1% women) 
      with a mean age of 38.0 (range 18-68) years participated in the study. Overall, 118 
      individuals (15.9%) had NAFLD, of whom 94.1% had mild steatosis. Age >40 years was 
      significantly associated with having NAFLD compared with <30 years of age with no 
      difference found in NAFLD between ethnic groups (Luo, Kamba, Maasai). All body 
      composition and clinical measurements were associated with NAFLD (p < 0.045 for OR). 
      CONCLUSION: Finding lower odds for NAFLD in men was unexpected, as was the lack of 
      differences in NAFLD among the ethnic groups, while higher odds for NAFLD with 
      increasing age and in urban vs. rural populations was expected. Especially the 
      sex-specific results warrant further studies in black African populations on biology 
      of body composition for having NAFLD, and whether this translates into insulin 
      resistance and higher risk of diabetes and consequently cardiovascular disease in 
      black African women.

TI  - Whey Protein Supplementation Is Superior to Leucine-Matched Collagen Peptides to

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of supplementation of whey 
      protein (WP) versus leucine-matched collagen peptides (CP) on muscle thickness MT 
      and performance after a resistance training (RT) program in young adults. Twenty-two 
      healthy untrained participants were randomly assigned to either a WP (n = 11) or 
      leucine-matched CP (n = 11) group and then submitted to a supervised 10-week RT 
      program (3 days/week). The groups were supplemented with an equivalent amount of WP 
      (35 g, containing 3.0 g of leucine) and CP (35 g, containing 1.0 g of leucine and 
      2.0 g of free leucine) during the intervention period (after each workout and in the 
      evening on nontraining days). MT of the vastus lateralis and biceps brachii, 
      isokinetic peak torque and mean power output of the elbow flexors, and peak power 
      output of the lower body were assessed before and after the RT program. The WP group 
      experienced a greater (interaction, p < .05) increase in the vastus lateralis 
      (effect size, WP = 0.68 vs. CP = 0.38; % Δ, WP = 8.4 ± 2.5 vs. CP = 5.6 ± 2.6%) and 
      biceps brachii muscle thickness (effect size, WP = 0.61 vs. CP = 0.35; % , WP = 10.1 
      ± 3.8 vs. CP = 6.0 ± 3.2%), with a similar increase in muscle performance (peak 
      torque, mean power output, and peak power output) between groups (time p < .05). 
      Supplementation with WP was superior to leucine content-matched CP supplementation 
      in increasing muscle size, but not strength and power, after a 10-week RT program in 
      young adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the longitudinal association between participation in social 
      activities and healthy lifestyle behaviours. STUDY DESIGN: This 2-year follow-up 
      study used data from 6168 older adults (73.5 ± 5.3 years; 49% men). We studied 
      participation in five types of social activities at baseline: participation in 
      volunteer, sports, hobbies, senior clubs, and neighbourhood-association groups. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The healthy lifestyle behaviours were physical activity (time 
      spent walking: ≥150 min/week; or less), eating habits (dietary variety score: ≥4 
      points; or less), and intellectual activity (subcomponents of the Tokyo Metropolitan 
      Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence: 4 points; or less). RESULTS: In the 
      follow-up survey, 19% of participants were physically inactive, 53% had unfavourable 
      eating habits, and 34% had diminished intellectual activity. Multilevel modified 
      Poisson regression analysis showed that participation in sports groups was 
      associated with a lower relative risk (RR) of physical inactivity (RR=0.82 [0.72, 
      0.93]) and unfavourable eating habits (RR=0.95 [0.90, 1.00]). Participation in hobby 
      groups reduced the RR of unfavourable eating habits (RR=0.93 [0.90, 0.97]) and 
      diminished intellectual activity (RR=0.90 [0.85, 0.96]). Participation in 
      volunteering was associated with a lower RR of diminished intellectual activity 
      (RR=0.84 [0.75, 0.95]). Relative to non-participation, participating in two or more 
      social activities was associated with a 9% (95% CI: 0.83, 1.00) lower RR for 
      physical inactivity, a 12% (95% CI: 0.82, 0.95) lower RR for unfavourable eating 
      habits, and a 17% (95% CI: 0.77, 0.89) lower RR for diminished intellectual 
      activity. CONCLUSIONS: Both the nature and the number of social activities determine 
      the longitudinal effects of social participation on healthy lifestyle behaviours.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns have affected daily lives of the 
      communities worldwide. This study aims to determine the lifestyle behaviours and 
      their associations with body weight changes among Malaysian adults during the 
      Movement Control Order (MCO) due to COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of 1319 
      Malaysian adults participated in this cross-sectional online survey. Information on 
      anthropometric data including body weight and height, and lifestyle behaviours 
      including eating pattern, physical activity, and sleep pattern were self-reported by 
      the respondents. A multivariable generalised linear mixed model was used to assess 
      the associations between lifestyle behaviours and body weight changes with 
      adjustment of confounding factors; namely, age, sex, ethnicity, and body weight 
      status before MCO. RESULTS: During MCO, 41.2% of the respondents perceived that 
      their eating patterns were healthier, but 36.3% reduced their physical activities, 
      and 25.7% had a poorer sleep quality. Further, the proportion of adults who reported 
      having lose weight (32.2%) was almost similar to those who reported having gained 
      weight (30.7%). Lifestyle behaviours including less frequent practice of healthy 
      cooking methods and lunch skipping were associated with weight gain, while less 
      frequent consumption of high fat foods, more frequent physical activity, and good 
      sleep latency were associated with lower risk of weight gain. In contrast, 
      practicing healthy eating concept, skipped lunch, and more frequent physical 
      activity were significantly associated with weight loss. CONCLUSION: Lifestyle 
      behaviours were associated with body weight changes during MCO. While the COVID-19 
      pandemic lockdown is necessary to prevent further spread of the disease, promoting 
      healthy lifestyle practices during lockdown should be implemented for a healthy 
      weight and better health.

TI  - Validity of Estimating the Maximal Oxygen Consumption by Consumer Wearables: A 
      Systematic Review with Meta-analysis and Expert Statement of the INTERLIVE Network.
LID - 10.1007/s40279-021-01639-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Technological advances have recently made possible the estimation of 
      maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2max)) by consumer wearables. However, the validity 
      of such estimations has not been systematically summarized using meta-analytic 
      methods and there are no standards guiding the validation protocols. OBJECTIVE: The 
      aim was to (1) quantitatively summarize previous studies investigating the validity 
      of the VO(2max) estimated by consumer wearables and (2) provide best-practice 
      recommendations for future validation studies. METHODS: First, we conducted a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis of studies validating the estimation of VO(2max) 
      by wearables. Second, based on the state of knowledge (derived from the systematic 
      review) combined with the expert discussion between the members of the Towards 
      Intelligent Health and Well-Being Network of Physical Activity Assessment 
      (INTERLIVE) consortium, we provided a set of best-practice recommendations for 
      validation protocols. RESULTS: Fourteen validation studies were included in the 
      systematic review and meta-analysis. Meta-analysis results revealed that wearables 
      using resting condition information in their algorithms significantly overestimated 
      VO(2max) (bias 2.17 ml·kg(-1)·min(-1); limits of agreement - 13.07 to 
      17.41 ml·kg(-1)·min(-1)), while devices using exercise-based information in their 
      algorithms showed a lower systematic and random error (bias 
      - 0.09 ml·kg(-1)·min(-1); limits of agreement - 9.92 to 9.74 ml·kg(-1)·min(-1)). The 
      INTERLIVE consortium proposed six key domains to be considered for validating 
      wearable devices estimating VO(2max), concerning the following: the target 
      population, reference standard, index measure, testing conditions, data processing, 
      and statistical analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that the 
      estimations of VO(2max) by wearables that use exercise-based algorithms provide 
      higher accuracy than those based on resting conditions. The exercise-based 
      estimation seems to be optimal for measuring VO(2max) at the population level, yet 
      the estimation error at the individual level is large, and, therefore, for 
      sport/clinical purposes these methods still need improvement. The INTERLIVE network 
      hereby provides best-practice recommendations to be used in future protocols to move 
      towards a more accurate, transparent and comparable validation of VO(2max) derived 
      from wearables. PROSPERO ID: CRD42021246192.

TI  - Long-term Effectiveness of a Smartphone App Combined With a Smart Band on Weight 
      Loss, Physical Activity, and Caloric Intake in a Population With Overweight and 
      Obesity (Evident 3 Study): Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e30416
LID - 10.2196/30416 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multicomponent mobile health approaches can improve lifestyle 
      intervention results, although little is known about their long-term effectiveness. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the long-term effectiveness (12 months) of a 
      multicomponent mobile health intervention-combining a smartphone app, an activity 
      tracker wristband, and brief counseling, compared with a brief counseling group 
      only-on weight loss and improving body composition, physical activity, and caloric 
      intake in Spanish sedentary adults with overweight or obesity. METHODS: We conducted 
      a randomized controlled, multicenter clinical trial (Evident 3). A total of 650 
      participants were recruited from 5 primary care centers, with 318 participants in 
      the intervention group (IG) and 332 in the control group (CG). All participants were 
      briefly counseled about a healthy diet and physical activity at the baseline visit. 
      For the 3-month intervention period, the IG received training to use the app to 
      promote healthy lifestyles and the smart band (Mi Band 2, Xiaomi). All measurements 
      were performed at baseline and at 3 and 12 months. Physical activity was measured 
      using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form. Nutritional 
      habits were assessed using the Food Frequency Questionnaire and Adherence to 
      Mediterranean diet questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the 650 participants included, 563 
      (86.6%) completed the 3-month visit and 443 (68.2%) completed the 12-month visit. 
      After 12 months, the IG showed net differences in weight (-0.26, 95% CI -1.21 to 
      0.70 kg; P=.02), BMI (-0.06, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.28 points; P=.01), waist-height ratio 
      (-0.25, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.44; P=.03), body adiposity index (-0.33, 95% CI -0.77 to 
      0.11; P=.03), waist circumference (-0.48, 95% CI -1.62 to 0.66 cm, P=.04) and hip 
      circumference (-0.69, 95% CI -1.62 to 0.25 cm; P=.03). Both groups lowered daily 
      caloric intake and increased adherence to the Mediterranean diet, with no 
      differences between the groups. The IG increased light physical activity time (32.6, 
      95% CI -30.3 to 95.04 min/week; P=.02) compared with the CG. Analyses by subgroup 
      showed changes in body composition variables in women, people aged >50 years, and 
      married people. CONCLUSIONS: The low-intensity intervention of the Evident 3 study 
      showed, in the IG, benefits in weight loss, some body composition variables, and 
      time spent in light physical activity compared with the CG at 3 months, but once the 
      devices were collected, the downward trend was not maintained at the 12-month 
      follow-up. No differences in nutritional outcomes were observed between the groups.

TI  - Fewer daily steps are associated with greater cartilage oligomeric matrix protein 
      response to loading post-ACL reconstruction.
LID - 10.1002/jor.25268 [doi]
AB  - Aberrant joint loading contributes to the development of posttraumatic knee 
      osteoarthritis (PTOA) following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR); 
      yet little is known about the association between joint loading due to daily walking 
      and cartilage health post-ACLR. Accelerometer-based measures of daily steps and 
      cadence (i.e., rate of steps/min) provide information regarding daily walking in a 
      real-world setting. The purpose of this study was to determine the association 
      between changes in serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP; %∆COMP), a 
      mechanosensitive biomarker that is associated with osteoarthritis progression, 
      following a standardized walking protocol and daily walking in individuals with ACLR 
      and uninjured controls. Daily walking was assessed over 7 days using an 
      accelerometer worn on the right hip in 31 individuals with ACLR and 21 controls and 
      quantified as mean steps/day and time spent in ≥100 steps/min. Serum COMP was 
      measured before and following a 3000-step walking protocol at a preferred speed. 
      %∆COMP was calculated as a change in COMP relative to the prewalking value. Linear 
      regressions were used to examine associations between daily walking and %∆COMP after 
      adjusting for preferred speed. Fewer daily steps (ΔR(2)  = 0.18, p = 0.02) and fewer 
      minutes spent in ≥100 steps/min (ΔR(2)  = 0.16, p = 0.03) were associated with 
      greater %∆COMP following walking in individuals with ACLR; no statistically 
      significant associations existed in controls (daily steps: ΔR(2)  = 0.03, p = 0.47; 
      time ≥100 steps/min: ΔR(2)  < 0.01, p = 0.81). Clinical significance: Individuals 
      with ACLR who engage in less daily walking undergo greater %ΔCOMP, which may 
      represent greater cartilage degradation or turnover in response to walking.

      type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized double-blind clinical trial.
LID - 10.1111/bcp.15222 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Chronic inflammation is one of the major challenges in the management of 
      obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Our primary aim was to assess the 
      anti-inflammatory effects of Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) supplementation and 
      concurrent training in obese men with T2DM. METHODS: Sixty obese men with T2DM 
      (age = 39 ± 5 years; body mass = 93.9 ± 6 kg) were randomly assigned to four groups; 
      concurrent training + placebo (CT; n = 15), saffron supplementation (S; n = 15), 
      concurrent training + saffron supplementation (CTS; n = 15), or control (CON; 
      n = 15). The participants in the CT group performed concurrent training (resistance 
      + aerobic) three times per week for 12 weeks and received daily one pill of placebo 
      (maltodextrin); the participants in the S group supplemented with one pill of 100 mg 
      of saffron daily, and the participants in the CTS group participated in both saffron 
      and training intervention while CON group continued regular lifestyle (no training 
      or no supplementation). Inflammatory markers, body composition (evaluated by a 
      multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance device; Jawon X-Contact 356), and metabolic 
      profile were evaluated before and after interventions. RESULTS: All three 
      interventions significantly (p<0.05) decreased TNF-α (CT = -4.22, S = -1.91, CTS = 
      -9.69 pg/mL), hs-CRP (CT = -0.13, S = -0.1, CTS = -0.32 ng/mL), IL-6 (CT = -6.84, S 
      = -6.36, CTS = -13.55 pg/mL), IL-1β (CT = -8.85, S = -6.46, CTS = -19.8 pg/mL), FBG 
      (CT = -6.97, S = -2.45, CTS = -13.86 mg/dL), insulin (CT = -0.13, S = -0.03, CTS = 
      -0.21 mU/L), HOMA-IR (CT = -0.12, S = -0.04, CTS = -0.21), HbA1c (CT = -0.17, S = 
      -0.11, CTS = -0.26 %), and increased IL-10 (CT = 1.09, S= 0.53, CTS = 2.27 pg/mL) 
      concentrations. There was a positive correlation between changes in BFP with hs-CRP, 
      IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, and IL-10 concentrations across the intervention groups. 
      Additionally, significant differences were observed between the changes for all 
      variables in the CTS group compared to CT, S, and CON groups (p<0.05) CONCLUSION: It 
      seems that an interactive of saffron supplementation and concurrent training has 
      more efficient effects on the anti-inflammatory status compared to the saffron 
      supplementation or concurrent training alone.

AB  - This study aimed to compare the cross-education effect of unilateral stretching 
      intervention programs with two different intensities (high- vs. low-intensity) on 
      dorsiflexion range of motion (DF ROM), muscle stiffness, and muscle architecture 
      following a 4-week stretching intervention. Twenty-eight healthy males were randomly 
      allocated into two groups: a high-intensity static stretching (HI-SS) intervention 
      group (n = 14; stretch intensity 6-7 out of 10) and a low-intensity static 
      stretching (LI-SS) intervention group (n = 14; stretch intensity 0-1 out of 10). The 
      participants were asked to stretch their dominant leg (prefer to kick a ball) for 
      4 weeks (3 × week for 3 × 60 s). Before and after the intervention, the non-trained 
      leg passive properties (DF ROM, passive torque, and muscle stiffness) of the plantar 
      flexors and the muscle architecture of the gastrocnemius medialis (muscle thickness, 
      pennation angle, and fascicle length) were measured. Non-trained DF ROM and passive 
      torque at DF ROM were significantly increased in the HI-SS group (p < 0.01, 
      d = 0.64, 50.6%, and p = 0.044, d = 0.36, 18.2%, respectively), but not in the LI-SS 
      group. Moreover, there were no significant changes in muscle stiffness and muscle 
      architecture in both groups. For rehabilitation settings, a high-intensity SS 
      intervention is required to increase the DF ROM of the non-trained limb. However, 
      the increases in DF ROM seem to be related to changes in stretch tolerance and not 
      to changes in muscle architecture or muscle stiffness.

TI  - Individual participant data (IPD)-level meta-analysis of randomised controlled 
      trials to estimate the vitamin D dietary requirements in dark-skinned individuals 
      resident at high latitude.
PG  - 1015-1034
LID - 10.1007/s00394-021-02699-6 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT AND PURPOSE: There is an urgent need to develop vitamin D dietary 
      recommendations for dark-skinned populations resident at high latitude. Using data 
      from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with vitamin D(3)-supplements/fortified 
      foods, we undertook an individual participant data-level meta-regression (IPD) 
      analysis of the response of wintertime serum 25-hydroxyvitamin (25(OH)D) to total 
      vitamin D intake among dark-skinned children and adults residing at ≥ 40° N and 
      derived dietary requirement values for vitamin D. METHODS: IPD analysis using data 
      from 677 dark-skinned participants (of Black or South Asian descent; ages 
      5-86 years) in 10 RCTs with vitamin D supplements/fortified foods identified via a 
      systematic review and predefined eligibility criteria. Outcome measures were vitamin 
      D intake estimates across a range of 25(OH)D thresholds. RESULTS: To maintain serum 
      25(OH)D concentrations ≥ 25 and 30 nmol/L in 97.5% of individuals, 23.9 and 
      27.3 µg/day of vitamin D, respectively, were required among South Asian and 24.1 and 
      33.2 µg/day, respectively, among Black participants. Overall, our age-stratified 
      intake estimates did not exceed age-specific Tolerable Upper Intake Levels for 
      vitamin D. The vitamin D intake required by dark-skinned individuals to maintain 
      97.5% of winter 25(OH)D concentrations ≥ 50 nmol/L was 66.8 µg/day. This intake 
      predicted that the upper 2.5% of individuals could potentially achieve serum 25(OH)D 
      concentrations ≥ 158 nmol/L, which has been linked to potential adverse effects in 
      older adults in supplementation studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our IPD-derived vitamin D 
      intakes required to maintain 97.5% of winter 25(OH)D concentrations ≥ 25, 30 and 
      50 nmol/L are substantially higher than the equivalent estimates for White 
      individuals. These requirement estimates are also higher than those currently 
      recommended internationally by several agencies, which are based predominantly on 
      data from Whites and derived from standard meta-regression based on aggregate data. 
      Much more work is needed in dark-skinned populations both in the dose-response 
      relationship and risk characterisation for health outcomes. TRAIL REGISTRATION:

AB  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disease of the pulmonary 
      vasculature that leads to right ventricular failure. Skeletal muscle maladaptations 
      limit physical activity and may contribute to disease progression. The role of 
      alarmin/inflammatory signaling in PAH respiratory muscle dysfunction is unknown. We 
      hypothesized that diaphragm mitochondrial and contractile functions are impaired in 
      SU5416/hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension due to increased systemic IL-33 
      signaling. We induced pulmonary hypertension in adult C57Bl/6 J (WT) and ST2 
      (IL1RL1) gene ablated mice by SU5416/hypoxia (SuHx). We measured diaphragm fiber 
      mitochondrial respiration, inflammatory markers, and contractile function ex vivo. 
      SuHx reduced coupled and uncoupled permeabilized myofiber respiration by ∼40 %. 
      During coupled respiration with complex I substrates, ST2(-/-) attenuated SuHx 
      inhibition of mitochondrial respiration (genotype × treatment interaction 
      F[1,67] = 3.3, p = 0.07, η(2) = 0.04). Flux control ratio and coupling efficiency 
      were not affected by SuHx or genotype. A higher substrate control ratio for 
      succinate was observed in SuHx fibers and attenuated in ST2(-/-) fibers 
      (F[1,67] = 5.3, p < 0.05, η(2) = 0.07). Diaphragm TNFα, but not IL-33 or NFkB, was 
      increased in SuHx vs. DMSO in both genotypes (F[1,43] = 4.7, p < 0.05, η(2) = 0.1). 
      Diaphragm force-frequency relationships were right-shifted in SuHx vs. WT 
      (F[3,440] = 8.4, p < 0.05, η(2) = 0.0025). There was no effect of ST2(-/-) on the 
      force-frequency relationship. Force decay during a fatigue protocol at 100 Hz, but 
      not at 40 Hz, was attenuated by SuHx vs. DMSO in both genotypes (F[1,41] = 5.6, 
      p < 0.05, η(2) = 0.11). SuHx mice exhibit a modest compensation in diaphragm 
      contractility and mitochondrial dysfunction during coupled respiration; the latter 
      partially regulated through ST2 signaling.

TI  - Alleviating Oxidative Damage-Induced Telomere Attrition: a Potential Mechanism for 
      Inhibition by Folic Acid of Apoptosis in Neural Stem Cells.
PG  - 590-602
LID - 10.1007/s12035-021-02623-3 [doi]
AB  - DNA oxidative damage can cause telomere attrition or dysfunction that triggers cell 
      senescence and apoptosis. The hypothesis of this study is that folic acid decreases 
      apoptosis in neural stem cells (NSCs) by preventing oxidative stress-induced 
      telomere attrition. Primary cultures of NSCs were incubated for 9 days with various 
      concentrations of folic acid (0-40 µM) and then incubated for 24 h with a 
      combination of folic acid and an oxidant (100-µM hydrogen peroxide, H(2)O(2)), 
      antioxidant (10-mM N-acetyl-L-cysteine, NAC), or vehicle. Intracellular folate 
      concentration, apoptosis rate, cell proliferative capacity, telomere length, 
      telomeric DNA oxidative damage, telomerase activity, intracellular reactive oxygen 
      species (ROS) levels, cellular oxidative damage, and intracellular antioxidant 
      enzyme activities were determined. The results showed that folic acid deficiency in 
      NSCs decreased intracellular folate concentration, cell proliferation, telomere 
      length, and telomerase activity but increased apoptosis, telomeric DNA oxidative 
      damage, and intracellular ROS levels. In contrast, folic acid supplementation 
      dose-dependently increased intracellular folate concentration, cell proliferative 
      capacity, telomere length, and telomerase activity but decreased apoptosis, 
      telomeric DNA oxidative damage, and intracellular ROS levels. Exposure to H(2)O(2) 
      aggravated telomere attrition and oxidative damage, whereas NAC alleviated the 
      latter. High doses of folic acid prevented telomere attrition and telomeric DNA 
      oxidative damage by H(2)O(2). In conclusion, inhibition of telomeric DNA oxidative 
      damage and telomere attrition in NSCs may be potential mechanisms of inhibiting NSC 
      apoptosis by folic acid.

TI  - Analysis of the SYSDIET Healthy Nordic Diet randomized trial based on metabolic 
      profiling reveal beneficial effects on glucose metabolism and blood lipids.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Intake assessment in multicenter trials is challenging, yet 
      important for accurate outcome evaluation. The present study aimed to characterize a 
      multicenter randomized controlled trial with a healthy Nordic diet (HND) compared to 
      a Control diet (CD) by plasma and urine metabolic profiles and to associate them 
      with cardiometabolic markers. METHODS: During 18-24 weeks of intervention, 200 
      participants with metabolic syndrome were advised at six centres to eat either HND 
      (e.g. whole-grain products, berries, rapeseed oil, fish and low-fat dairy) or CD 
      while being weight stable. Of these 166/159 completers delivered blood/urine 
      samples. Metabolic profiles of fasting plasma and 24 h pooled urine were analysed to 
      identify characteristic diet-related patterns. Principal components analysis (PCA) 
      scores (i.e. PC1 and PC2 scores) were used to test their combined effect on blood 
      glucose response (primary endpoint), serum lipoproteins, triglycerides, and 
      inflammatory markers. RESULTS: The profiles distinguished HND and CD with AUC of 
      0.96 ± 0.03 and 0.93 ± 0.02 for plasma and urine, respectively, with limited 
      heterogeneity between centers, reflecting markers of key foods. Markers of fish, 
      whole grain and polyunsaturated lipids characterized HND, while CD was reflected by 
      lipids containing palmitoleic acid. The PC1 scores of plasma metabolites 
      characterizing the intervention is associated with HDL (β = 0.05; 95% CI: 0.02, 
      0.08; P = 0.001) and triglycerides (β = -0.06; 95% CI: -0.09, -0.03; P < 0.001). PC2 
      scores were related with glucose metabolism (2 h Glucose, β = 0.1; 95% CI: 0.05, 
      0.15; P < 0.001), LDL (β = 0.06; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.1; P = 0.02) and triglycerides 
      (β = 0.11; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.15; P < 0.001). For urine, the scores were related with 
      LDL cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma and urine metabolite profiles from SYSDIET 
      reflected good compliance with dietary recommendations across the region. The scores 
      of metabolites characterizing the diets associated with outcomes related with 
      cardio-metabolic risk. Our analysis therefore offers a novel way to approach a per 
      protocol analysis with a balanced compliance assessment in larger multicentre 
      dietary trials. The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov with NCT00992641.

TI  - The associations between motivational climate, basic psychological needs and dropout 
      in volleyball - a comparison across competitive levels.
PG  - 1-29
LID - 10.1080/17461391.2022.2041100 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the importance of motivational climate 
      for the satisfaction of psychological needs and dropout in recreational, 
      intermediate and elite volleyball. 7936 volleyball players from all 321 volleyball 
      clubs across Denmark were invited to participate in the study. 3330 answered the 
      questionnaire and 2150 were included in the analysis. Dropout from Volleyball was 
      measured as the proportion of players that had stopped playing volleyball over the 
      last year. The coach-created motivational climate was measured using the 
      Motivational Climate Scale for Youth Sports. The satisfaction of players' 
      psychological needs was measured using an adapted version of the basic psychological 
      needs in exercise scale. The psychometric scales were validated and showed good 
      model fit. For volleyball players of all levels, the degree of mastery climate 
      predicted the satisfaction of the players' basic psychological needs satisfaction 
      during volleyball which was in turn associated with lower dropout rates. Performance 
      climate had a weak negative association with the satisfaction of psychological needs 
      on the intermediate level only. When adjusting the models for the negative 
      association between performance climate and mastery climate this negative 
      association became nonsignificant and a weak positive association to needs 
      satisfaction emerged for players at the elite level. Findings confirm that the 
      coach-created mastery climate in volleyball teams is important for the satisfaction 
      of players' basic psychological needs and continuation within the sport across the 
      recreational, intermediate and elite levels.

TI  - Effectiveness of Nutritional Strategies on Improving the Quality of Diet of Children 
      from 6 to 12 Years Old: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/nu14020372 [doi]
LID - 372
AB  - Dietary habits, that are formed during childhood and consolidated in adulthood, are 
      known to influence the development of future chronic diseases such as metabolic 
      syndrome or type 2 diabetes. The aim of this review was to evaluate the 
      effectiveness of nutritional interventions carried out in recent years focused on 
      improving the quality of the diet of the child population. A systematic search of 
      the PubMed and Scopus databases was performed from January 2011 until September 
      2021. A total of 910 articles were identified and screened based on their title, 
      abstract and full text. Finally, 12 articles were included in the current systematic 
      review. Of those, in six studies the intervention was based on the provision of 
      healthy meals and in the other six studies the intervention focused on modifying the 
      school environment. Six of the studies selected included other components in their 
      intervention such as nutritional education sessions, physical activity and/or 
      families. A wide variety of methods were used for diet assessments, from direct 
      method to questionnaires. The results suggest that interventions that modify the 
      school environment or provide different meals or snacks may be effective in 
      improving children's dietary patterns, both in the short and long term. Further 
      research is necessary to evaluate the real effectiveness of strategies with 
      multidisciplinary approach (nutritional sessions, physical activity and family's 
      involvement).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This exploratory study investigated whether performance in a 
      behavioural inhibition task followed the shape proposed by the Maximum Adaptability 
      Model during progressive exertional heat stress-that is, an initial improvement in 
      cognitive performance is followed by a plateau, and subsequent decline once body 
      temperature continues to rise unabated. METHODS: Seventeen adult males walked on a 
      treadmill at 4 km h(-1) (1% grade) for up to 120 min, in three protective clothing 
      ensembles, across three simulated environments. The simulated environments were 
      equivalent to wet bulb globe temperatures 21, 30 and 37 °C. Cognitive function was 
      assessed using a modified colour-word Stroop Task, with performance expressed as 
      inverse efficiency scores in the simple (congruent) and more complex (incongruent) 
      task conditions. The Stroop Task was completed before a trial, at termination, and 
      every 30 min during walking, and core body temperature was continuously measured. 
      Data were modelled using Bayesian penalised regression, with core body temperature 
      included as a non-linear term (i.e., second degree polynomial). RESULTS: We did not 
      find any evidence that core body temperature had an effect on congruent or 
      incongruent inverse efficiency scores, and no evidence that the relationship between 
      these variables followed the shaped described by the Maximum Adaptability Model. 
      There was, however, evidence that higher pre-exercise serum osmolality values were 
      associated with slower congruent (β = 9.19) and incongruent (β = 8.67) inverse 
      efficiency scores. The posterior probability that these effects were greater than 
      zero was 0.971 and 0.952, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In young, fit men, performance 
      in the behavioural inhibition task was unaffected by increases in body temperature 
      up to 39 °C and did not follow the shape proposed by the Maximum Adaptability Model. 
      A secondary finding of the study was that pre-exercise hydration status affected 
      performance in the inhibition task. Future studies are needed to confirm this 
      result.

TI  - The rating of perceived exertion is able to differentiate the post-matches 
      metabolomic profile of elite U-20 soccer players.
PG  - 371-382

AB  - PURPOSE: The study aimed to assess the metabolic impact of elite Brazilian U-20 
      players using the rating of perceived exertion scale (RPE) to discriminate 
      metabolomics sensitivity post-two soccer games separated by a short recovery 
      interval. METHODS: Urine was collected immediately and then 20 h after two soccer 
      matches of elite Brazilian U-20 players. RPE was collected after games. The spectra 
      were pre-processed using TopSpin(®)3.2 software. Chenomx(®)software was used to 
      identify metabolites in the urine through the available database. RESULTS: The 
      results showed that the metabolic pathways related to energy production, cellular 
      damage, and organic stresses were changed immediately after the game. 20 h after the 
      games, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways related to cell recovery were 
      identified (e.g., gallic acid, ascorbate, and betaine). The matrix of positive 
      correlations between metabolites was more predominant and stronger after game 2 than 
      game 1. T-distribution registered metabolites discriminated below and above 7 on the 
      RPE scale. Athletes with higher RPE values showed a high metabolite profile related 
      to muscle damage (e.g., creatine, creatinine, and glycine) and energy production 
      (e.g., creatine, formate, pyruvate, 1,3 dihydroxyacetone) 20 h post-soccer match. 
      There was a different metabolic profile between athletes with higher and lower RPE 
      values. CONCLUSION: Metabolomics analysis made it possible to observe the metabolic 
      impacts of energy production and muscular damage. RPE identified internal load 
      changes within the group as a result of match intensity in soccer. The correlation 
      matrix indicated a greater predominance of positive and strong correlations between 
      metabolites in the second game compared to the first game.

TI  - Test-retest reliability of skeletal muscle oxygenation measurement using 
      near-infrared spectroscopy during exercise in patients with sport-related iliac 
      artery flow limitation.
PG  - 114-126
LID - 10.1111/cpf.12738 [doi]
AB  - The ankle-brachial index is an accurate tool for detecting claudication in 
      atherosclerotic patients. However, this technique fails to identify subtle flow 
      limitations of the iliac arteries (FLIA) in endurance athletes. Near-infrared 
      spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive technique that measures skeletal muscle tissue 
      oxygenation status. The aim of the present study is to examine the absolute and 
      relative test-retest reliability of NIRS and evaluate its potential as a diagnostic 
      tool in FLIA. NIRS-derived exercise variables were analyzed during exercise and 
      recovery in FLIA 17 patients and 19 healthy controls. The relative reliability of 
      absolute variables (such as the maximal value) were slight to yet predominantly 
      substantial (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC], ICC range: 0.06-0.76) with 
      good to excellent absolute reliability (absolute limits of agreement [ALoA], ALoA 
      range: 0.8 ± 10.2 to 0.7 ± 13.1; coefficient of variation [CV], CV range: 5%-11%). 
      Absolute values encompassing signal amplitudes showed moderate to almost perfect 
      relative reliability (ICC range: 0.51-0.89) and poor to good absolute reliability 
      (ALoA range: -1.3 ± 7.0 to -2.5 ± 15.7; CV range: 15%-32%). Kinetic variables showed 
      moderate to almost perfect relative reliability for most recovery kinetics variables 
      (ICC range: 0.54-0.86) with fair to good absolute reliability (ALoA range: 
      0.4 ± 12.2 to 3.9 ± 37.9; CV range: 18%-27%). Particularly, kinetic variables showed 
      significant differences between patients and healthy subjects. NIRS is found to be a 
      reliable method for examining muscle tissue oxygenation variables. Given the 
      significant differences in especially recovery kinetics between normal subjects and 
      patients, NIRS may contribute to diagnosing FLIA in endurance athletes.

TI  - The role of combined modifiable lifestyle behaviors in the association between 
      exposure to stressors and allostatic load: A systematic review of observational 
      studies.

LID - S0306-4530(22)00009-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2022.105668 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to stressors can evoke psychological, physiological, and 
      behavioral stress responses, which may lead to the adoption of health-damaging 
      behaviors that dysregulate multiple biological systems contributing to a high 
      allostatic load. This review explored the role of combined modifiable lifestyle 
      behaviors in the relationship between stressors and allostatic load among healthy 
      adults. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in Medline Complete, PsycINFO, 
      CINAHL, and Embase databases up to September 2021. The PRISMA guidelines guided 
      reporting and study quality was assessed using the Strengthening the Reporting of 
      Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Checklist. RESULTS: Database searches 
      identified 319 papers. Eight cross-sectional and two longitudinal studies met our 
      inclusion criteria. Among the ten studies, combined modifiable lifestyle behaviors 
      partly explained the association between exposure to stressors and elevated 
      allostatic load in four cross-sectional and two longitudinal studies. CONCLUSION: 
      Some evidence suggests that combined modifiable lifestyle behaviors may help explain 
      the relationship between stressors and an elevated allostatic load. Further 
      longitudinal studies with mediation analyses would strengthen these findings and 
      help to confirm the mechanistic role of combined modifiable lifestyle behaviors 
      underlying the relationship between stress exposure and allostatic load.

TI  - Immediate Effects of Walking with a Knee Brace following Anterior Cruciate Ligament 
      Reconstruction: A Biomechanical, Biochemical, and Structural Approach.
LID - 10.4085/1062-6050-0700.20 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Individuals who undergo anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) 
      are at higher risk of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Altered joint tissue 
      loading caused by aberrant gait biomechanics leads to deleterious changes in joint 
      health linked to PTOA onset. Knee braces have been used to modify joint tissue 
      loading in individuals with joint injury; yet, the effects of walking with a brace 
      following ACLR on biomechanical, biological, and structural cartilage outcomes are 
      unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare biomechanical, biochemical, and structural outcomes 
      between braced and non-braced walking in ACLR individuals. DESIGN: Cross-over study. 
      SETTING: Research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: 34 individuals with unilateral ACLR 
      (time since ACLR = 50±37 months; 18 females, 16 males). INTERVENTIONS: Gait 
      bioemchanics were assessed during braced (Rebound Cartilage; Ossur, Reykavik, 
      Iceland) and unbraced conditions on separate days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vertical 
      ground reaction force (vGRF), knee flexion angle (KFA), and internal knee extension 
      moment (KEM) waveforms were evaluated throughout the stance phase and compared 
      between conditions. Percent changes of serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein 
      (%ΔCOMP) and femoral cartilage cross sectional area (%ΔCSA) measured via ultrasound 
      were calculated following a 3000-step walking protocol. RESULTS: Braced walking 
      increased KFA (largest difference: 3.56°; effect size: d=1.72) and increased KEM 
      (largest difference: 0.48 %Body Weight×Height; effect size: d=1.14) compared to 
      non-braced walking but did not influence vGRF. While there was no significant 
      difference (p=0.196) in %ΔCOMP between the braced and non-braced conditions in the 
      entire cohort(n=30), there was a larger increase (p=0.036) in %ΔCOMP during 
      non-braced compared to braced walking in individuals who demonstrated increased COMP 
      during non-braced walking. There was no difference (p=0.86) in %ΔCSA between the 
      braced and non-braced conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Braced walking may improve sagittal 
      plane gait biomechanics and %ΔCOMP in a subset of individuals who demonstrate a 
      typical increased COMP response to load (i.e., increase in COMP) following 
      non-braced walking.

TI  - Association between daily number of eating occasions with fasting glucose and 
      insulin sensitivity in adults from families at high risk for type 2 diabetes in 
      Europe: the Feel4Diabetes Study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the association between the number 
      of times one eats daily (termed eating occasions [EO]) with indices of glycemic 
      control and insulin resistance (IR) in a large sample of adults from families at 
      high risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from six European countries. The study 
      also considered sex and socioeconomic status (SES). METHODS: Standardized 
      questionnaires and procedures were used to assess sociodemographic characteristics, 
      dietary intake, sedentary behavior, and anthropometric and biochemical indices. 
      Univariate analysis of variance was used to investigate associations of daily EOs 
      with fasting glucose (FG), fasting insulin (FI), and IR. RESULTS: In 1552 adults 
      (41.6 ± 7.2 y), three to four daily EOs rather than less than three were inversely 
      associated with FG (β = -2.598; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.521 to -0.675), 
      independent of age, body mass index (BMI), dietary quality, and sedentary time. In 
      women, three to four EOs per day were also associated with FG (β = -3.071; 95% CI to 
      -5.573 to -0.570) independently of the mentioned confounders. In high SES 
      participants, having more than four EOs per day had an inverse association with FI 
      (β = -1.348; 95% CI to -2.583 to -0.114). No such associations were observed in men 
      or in low SES participants. CONCLUSION: In adults at high risk for T2DM, and 
      especially in women, having three to four daily EOs was inversely associated with 
      FG, whereas in high SES participants, more than four EOs was associated with FI. 
      Future studies should further elucidate the underlying mechanisms and offer insight 
      into the optimum number of daily EOs for the prevention of T2DM especially in men 
      and in adults with low SES where the number of daily EOs was not found to be 
      significantly related to glycemic indices.

TI  - Adolescents' dietary polyphenol intake in relation to serum total antioxidant 
      capacity: the HELENA study.
PG  - 71-81
LID - 10.1080/09637486.2021.1910631 [doi]
AB  - We evaluated the association between intake of total polyphenols, polyphenol classes 
      and the 10 most consumed individual polyphenols with serum total antioxidant 
      capacity (TAC) in 749 European adolescents (53% girls; 15% overweight; 
      12.5-17.5 years-old) from the cross-sectional HELENA study of 2006-2007. Dietary 
      polyphenol intake was calculated from two non-consecutive 24-h recalls matched with 
      the Phenol-Explorer database. Multilevel linear models examined the associations 
      between dietary polyphenols and TAC. Polyphenol intake was rather low (median = 
      321mg/day; p25 = 158; p75 = 536) and TAC was comparable to other literature findings 
      (median = 1.57 mmol/L; p25 = 1.45; p75 = 1.74). Total polyphenol intake, polyphenol 
      classes and the top 10 compounds were not associated with TAC in a linear, quadratic 
      or cubic way in partially or fully confounder-adjusted models. A direct 
      anti-oxidative effect of dietary polyphenol intake was not observed in European 
      adolescents. Polyphenol biomarkers and additional antioxidant measures are needed in 
      future prospective studies to confirm these results.

TI  - Developing and implementing a new methodology to test the affordability of currently 
      popular weight loss diet meal plans and healthy eating principles.
PG  - 23
LID - 10.1186/s12889-021-12447-4 [doi]
LID - 23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Weight loss diets continue to rise in popularity; however, the 
      associated costs are seldom reported. Certain weight loss diets may be unaffordable 
      and differ from their traditional nutrition composition to include non-conventional 
      premium products. In contrast, healthy eating principles such as the Australian 
      Guide to Healthy Eating (AGHE) and the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) place an 
      emphasis on fresh produce and staple foods but are sometimes thought to be 
      unaffordable. A new methodology was piloted to assess the cost of weight loss diets 
      using seven meal plans. METHODS: Seven meal plans were analysed to quantify the 
      absolute grams required of all ingredients across seven days and multiplied by the 
      cost of the ingredient per gram to determine the total cost of each ingredient based 
      on unit size and price. The weekly grocery shopping cost was determined through 
      summation of all ingredients and their entire unit size to compare weekly costs. 
      RESULTS: Weekly meal plans (absolute grams) cost between $93-193AUD. The AGHE meal 
      plan was the least expensive and 8 Weeks to Wow was the most expensive. Weekly 
      grocery shopping of entire units cost between $345-$625AUD, over $100AUD greater 
      than the spending of an average Australian ($237AUD/week). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      financial feasibility for long-term sustainment of weight loss diets may be 
      questionable for groups including low-income earners and low socioeconomic status. 
      Further, when dietary patterns are adapted for weight loss, or followed by 
      consumers, deviations from foundational principles tend to occur which may influence 
      overall cost.

TI  - A Comparative Study of Health Efficacy Indicators in Subjects with T2DM Applying

      Moderate-Intensity Continuous Training.

AB  - This study is aimed at comparing the effects of different exercise intensities, 
      namely, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous 
      training (MICT), on body composition, heart and lung fitness, and blood glucose, and 
      blood pressure indices in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), using power 
      cycling. A total of 96 T2DM volunteers who met the inclusion criteria were recruited 
      from a hospital in Yangpu, Shanghai. Based on the blood index data of their medical 
      examination results which comprised blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, 
      hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and insulin, 37 volunteers were included in the study. 
      Exercise prescription was determined based on T2DM exercise guidelines combined with 
      medical diagnosis and exercise test results, and the patients were randomly assigned 
      to three groups: HIIT group, MICT group, and control (CON) group. HIIT involved 
      one-minute power cycling (80%-95% maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max)), one-minute 
      passive or active rest (25%-30% VO2max), and two-minute rounds of eight groups. MICT 
      required the use of a power bike for 30 minutes of continuous training (50%-70% 
      VO2max) five times a week. The CON group was introduced to relevant medicine, 
      exercise, and nutrition knowledge. The exercise interventions were completed under 
      the supervision of an exercise instructor and hospital doctors. The same indicators 
      were measured after 12 weeks of intervention, and the results of the two tests 
      within and between groups were analyzed for comparison. The weight index of the MICT 
      intervention showed statistically significant within-group differences (difference = 
      3.52, 95% CI = 2.11-4.92, p = 0.001 < 0.01); group differences for the MICT and CON 
      groups were also statistically significant (difference = 3.52 ± 2.09, Cd1 = -0.39 ± 
      1.25, p = 0.004 < 0.01). Body mass index (BMI) analysis revealed that the overall 
      means of BMI indicators were not statistically different between groups (F = 0.369, 
      p = 0.694 > 0.05) and the before and after values of the MICT and CON (difference = 
      -1.30 ± 0.79, Cd1 = -0.18 ± 0.45, p = 0.001 < 0.01). No statistically significant 
      difference was observed in the overall mean VO(2)max index between the groups after 
      the 12-week intervention (F = 2.51, p = 0.100 > 0.05). A statistically significant 
      difference was found in the overall means of the data between the two groups 
      (difference = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.23-0.40, p = 0.001 < 0.01). Analysis of fasting blood 
      glucose (FBG) indicators revealed statistically significant differences between the 
      MICT and control groups (p = 0.028 < 0.05). Analysis of HbA1c and fasting insulin 
      (FI) indicators revealed no statistically significant difference in the overall 
      HbA1c index after the 12-week exercise intervention (F = 0.523, p = 0.598 > 0.05), 
      and the overall difference before and after the experiment between the groups was 
      statistically significant (F = 6.13, p = 0.006 < 0.01). No statistically significant 
      difference was found in the FI index overall after the 12-week exercise intervention 
      (F = 2.50, p = 0.1 > 0.05). Analysis of systolic blood pressure (SBP) revealed 
      statistically significant difference before and after the HIIT and CON interventions 
      (Hd7 = -1.10 ± 1.79, Cd7 = 1.2 ± 1.31, p = 0.018 < 0.05) and statistically 
      significant difference before and after the MICT and CON interventions (Md7 = -0.99 
      ± 0.91, Cd7 = 1.40 ± 1.78, p = 0.02 < 0.05). The diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 
      revealed no statistically significant within-group differences before and after. 
      Exercise interventions applying both low-volume HIIT and MICT, with both intensity 
      exercises designed for power cycling, improved health-related indicators in the 
      participants; low-volume HIIT had more time advantage. The current experiment 
      compared HIIT with MICT in a safe manner: 50% of the exercise time produced similar 
      benefits and advantages in the two indicators of VO(2)max and FI. However, MICT was 
      superior to HIIT in the two indicators of body weight (weight) and BMI. The effect 
      of power cycling on FI has the advantages of both aerobic and resistance exercise, 
      which may optimize the type, intensity, and time of exercise prescription according 
      to the individual or the type of exercise program. Our results provide a reference 
      for the personalization of exercise prescription for patients with T2DM.

TI  - Effects of Dietary Soy Protein Isolate Versus Isoflavones Alone on Poststroke 
      Skilled Ladder Rung Walking and Cortical mRNA Expression Differ in Adult Male Rats.
PG  - 158-165
LID - 10.1089/jmf.2020.0218 [doi]
AB  - Dietary soy protein isolate (SPI) and the isoflavones daidzein and genistein have 
      been shown to provide neuroprotection from stroke. However, the mechanisms remain 
      uncertain. We sought to determine whether the addition of isoflavones to a diet 
      containing caseinate (CAS) as the protein source would induce behavioral 
      neuroprotection similar to that seen previously in rats fed SPI. Furthermore, we 
      aimed to characterize the baseline and poststroke expression of mRNAs involved in 
      pathways previously published as perhaps mediating soy-based neuroprotection from 
      stroke and other markers of neuronal plasticity, oxidative stress, and inflammation. 
      Adult male rats were fed a semipurified diet containing (1) sodium caseinate (CAS), 
      (2) CAS plus daidzein and genistein (CAS+ISO), or (3) SPI for 2 weeks. A subset of 
      rats was euthanized, and tissue was collected for quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). 
      Remaining rats underwent a middle cerebral artery occlusion to induce a stroke. 
      Samples for qPCR were collected on day 3 poststroke. Rats fed SPI made fewer errors 
      on the skilled ladder rung walking task after stroke compared to rats fed CAS 
      (P < .05). Rats fed CAS+ISO were not different from rats fed CAS or SPI. Significant 
      effects of diet were found at day 0 for Syp, Pparg, and Ywhae and at day 3 for Rtn4 
      expression. We concluded that the benefits of SPI are not solely attributable to 
      daidzein and genistein.

TI  - The effect of Spirulina sauce, as a functional food, on cardiometabolic risk 
      factors, oxidative stress biomarkers, glycemic profile, and liver enzymes in

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study sought to investigate the effect of Spirulina on 
      cardiometabolic risk factors, oxidative stress biomarkers, glycemic profile, and 
      liver enzymes in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. METHODS: This 
      randomized, double-blind clinical trial was performed on 46 NAFLD patients. Subjects 
      were allocated to consume either Spirulina sauce or placebo, each 20 g/day for 
      8 weeks. Fatty liver grade, liver enzymes, anthropometric parameters, blood 
      pressure, and serum lipids, glucose, insulin, malondialdehyde, and antioxidant 
      capacity were assessed pre- and postintervention. RESULTS: Fatty liver grade was 
      significantly different between the two groups. A significant change for ALT 
      (alanine aminotransferase) and AST (aspartate aminotransferase) was seen between the 
      two groups (p = .03 and .02, respectively), while ALP (alkaline phosphatase) serum 
      levels were not significantly different within or between groups. Pertaining to 
      glycemic profile, all variables, except HOMA-IR, were not significantly different 
      within or between groups. Finally, statistically significant changes were seen in 
      both MDA (malondialdehyde) and TAC (total antioxidant capacity) among the groups 
      (p = .04 and <.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Spirulina may improve fatty liver 
      grade by modifying liver enzymes, oxidative stress, and some lipid profiles; 
      however, there was effect of Spirulina on anthropometric characteristics and blood 
      pressure.

TI  - Acute effect of different resistance training loads on perceived effort and 
      affectivity in older women: a cross-over and randomized study.
LID - 10.1007/s40520-021-02062-z [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the acute effects of 
      different resistance training loads on the session rating of perceived exertion 
      (sRPE) and feelings of pleasure displeasure (sFPD) of the session in older women. 
      METHODS: In a randomized, counterbalanced, and cross-over design, 16 older women 
      (66.1 ± 3.9 years, 67.0 ± 8.4 kg, 154.1 ± 6.8 cm, 28.3 ± 4.4 kg/m(2)) performed 3 
      sets of 8 exercises in three experimental conditions, 1 session with a heavy load 
      (HEV), one with a moderate load (MOD), and one session with a light load (LIT), all 
      performed until momentary muscle failure. The sRPE and sFPD were assessed 15 min 
      after the end of each session using specific scales. RESULTS: A significant 
      difference (P < 0.05) was observed among conditions for sFPD in which HEV produced 
      feelings of displeasure, and MOD produced greater feelings of pleasure 
      (HEV = -1.38 ± 1.7, MOD = 3.38 ± 1.2, LIT = 0.69 ± 1.04). For sRPE, a significant 
      (P < 0.05) difference was observed between MOD and LIT; whereby the LIT load induced 
      a greater score compared to the MOD load (HEV = 4.56 ± 1.4, MOD = 4.31 ± 1.7, 
      LIT = 5.75 ± 1.2). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the training load affects 
      perceived effort and feelings of pleasure/displeasure when exercise is performed 
      until concentric failure. The use of moderate loads induces greater pleasure 
      feelings and a reduced degree of effort in older women.

AB  - Childhood motor fitness is important for the physical and mental health of children 
      and the prevention of future lifestyle diseases. This study aimed to investigate how 
      energy intake from healthy foods and physical activity are associated with motor 
      fitness among first-grade children. First-grade children (aged 6-7 years) attending 
      three public elementary schools in Tokyo, Japan (n = 884), participated in this 
      cross-sectional study. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed, which 
      focused on lifestyle habits and required completion of a 1-day dietary record of 
      meals that children ate at home. School lunch consumption was also assessed. Motor 
      fitness was assessed by the New Physical Fitness Test (NPFT). Multiple regression 
      analysis was used to investigate the association of the amount of energy from 
      healthy foods and physical activity with NPFT scores. NPFT scores were positively 
      correlated with involvement in after school exercise classes, playing outside (in 
      boys only), and total energy intake. Energy intake from healthy foods showed a 
      positively associated with NPFT scores (boys, β = 0.120, p = 0.011; girls, β = 
      0.140, p = 0.004), while energy intake from unhealthy foods did not. Energy intake 
      from healthy foods was associated with motor fitness in children in addition to 
      physical activity.

AB  - QUESTION: In people with non-small cell lung cancer, what is the effect of 
      condensing 15 prehabilitation sessions into a 3-week regimen compared with a 5-week 
      regimen? DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial with concealed allocation, 
      intention-to-treat analysis and blinded assessment of the primary outcome. 
      PARTICIPANTS: People with diagnosed or suspected non-small cell lung cancer and 
      moderate-to-high risk of postoperative complications. INTERVENTION: Fifteen 
      supervised prehabilitation sessions delivered with either a dense regimen of five 
      sessions/week for 3 weeks (experimental group) or a non-dense regimen of three 
      sessions/week for 5 weeks (control group). OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was 
      the change in cardiorespiratory fitness measured by the V̇O(2peak) in ml/kg/min. The 
      secondary outcomes were the change in other variables of interest measured during 
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing, non-invasive nutritional markers, quadriceps 
      maximal voluntary isometric contractions, maximal inspiratory pressure, quality of 
      life, adherence and postoperative complications. RESULTS: Changes with the 
      experimental regimen were similar to or better than changes with the control regimen 
      for: V̇O(2peak) (MD 1.2 ml/kg/min, 95% CI -0.1 to 2.6); V̇E/V̇CO(2) slope (MD -3.6 
      points, 95% CI -8.7 to 1.5); and work rate at ventilatory threshold (MD 3.7 W, 95% 
      CI -5.6 to 13.0). The two regimens had similar effects on: peak work rate (MD 1.3 W, 
      95% CI -6.4 to 9.0), V̇O(2) at ventilatory threshold (MD 0.0 ml/kg/min, 95% CI -1.4 
      to 1.4); body mass index (MD -0.2 kg/m(2), 95% CI -0.5 to 0.1); and maximal 
      inspiratory pressure (MD -0.7 cmH(2)O, 95% CI -9.8 to 8.4). The relative effect was 
      uncertain for quadriceps maximal voluntary isometric contractions, quality of life 
      and complications. CONCLUSION: Condensing prehabilitation sessions led to similar or 
      better improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness and did not decrease adherence or 
      increase adverse events. This could increase the number of patients who can be 
      referred for prehabilitation, despite short presurgical periods. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Parental work hours and household income as determinants of unhealthy food and 
      beverage intake in young Australian children.
PG  - 1-29
LID - 10.1017/S1368980022000349 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined parental work hours and household income as 
      determinants of discretionary (energy dense, nutrient poor) food and beverage intake 
      in young children, including differences by eating occasion. DESIGN: Secondary 
      analysis of cross-sectional data. Three hierarchical regression models were 
      conducted with percent energy from discretionary food and beverages across the day, 
      at main meals, and at snack times being the outcomes. Dietary intake was assessed by 
      1x24-hour recall and 1-2x24-hour food record(s). Both maternal/paternal work hours 
      were included, and total household income. Covariates included household, parent and 
      child factors. SETTING: Data from the NOURISH/SAIDI studies were collected between 
      2008-13. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 526 mother-child dyads (median(IQR) 
      child age 1.99(1.96,2.03) years). Forty-one percent of mothers did not work while 
      57% of fathers worked 35-40 hours/week. Most (85%) households had an income of ≥$50k 
      AUD/year. RESULTS: Household income was consistently inversely associated with 
      discretionary energy intake (β= -0.12 to -0.15). Maternal part-time employment 
      (21-35 hours/week) predicted child consumption of discretionary energy at main meals 
      (β=0.10, p=0.04). Paternal unemployment predicted a lower proportion of 
      discretionary energy at snacks (β= -0.09, p=0.047). CONCLUSIONS: This work suggests 
      that household income should be addressed as a key opportunity-related barrier to 
      healthy food provision in families of young children. Strategies to reduce the time 
      burden of healthy main meal provision may be required in families where mothers 
      juggle longer part-time working hours with caregiving and domestic duties. The need 
      to consider the role of fathers and other parents/caregivers in shaping children's 
      intake was also highlighted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current recommendations for echocardiographic assessment of diastolic 
      function (2016 guidelines of the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE)/European 
      Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI) in patients with metabolic syndrome 
      and overweight/obesity result in a significant number of patients with indeterminate 
      diastolic dysfunction (LVDD). The aim of this article is to study whether the use of 
      the left atrial strain criterion (LALS) reduces the number of indeterminate 
      patients. METHODS: 229 patients were studied with a complete echocardiographic study 
      that included left ventricular longitudinal strain (LVLS) analysis, LALS and a 
      maximal ergospirometry test with assessment of oxygen uptake (VO(2max)). RESULTS: 
      The mean age was 65 ± 5 years, 153 (67%) males, with a mean EF of 60 ± 5%. The mean 
      LVLS was -19.4 ± 2% and the LALS Reservoir was 23.8 ± 7%. There were 140 patients 
      who did not meet LVDD criteria and 82 who did meet the indeterminate LVDD criterion. 
      When the left atrial volume index (LAVI) >34 ml/m(2) criterion was replaced in the 
      2016 ASE/EACVI algorithm by LALS Reservoir ≤20%, the number of indeterminate 
      patients was reduced from 36% to 23% (p < 0.001) at the expense of increasing normal 
      studies (61% and 74%). Adding the LALS Reservoir criterion ≤23% in the 82 patients 
      of the indeterminate group resulted in two groups with a different VO(2max) 
      (11.6 ± 3 and 18 ± 5 ml/kg/min, p:0.081). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the low 
      prevalence of diastolic dysfunction in overweight/obese patients with metabolic 
      syndrome. Adding left atrial strain criterion to the current recommendations 
      significantly reduces the number of indeterminate patients by reclassifying them as 
      normal.

TI  - Total energy expenditure is repeatable in adults but not associated with short-term 
      changes in body composition.

AB  - Low total energy expenditure (TEE, MJ/d) has been a hypothesized risk factor for 
      weight gain, but repeatability of TEE, a critical variable in longitudinal studies 
      of energy balance, is understudied. We examine repeated doubly labeled water (DLW) 
      measurements of TEE in 348 adults and 47 children from the IAEA DLW Database 
      (mean ± SD time interval: 1.9 ± 2.9 y) to assess repeatability of TEE, and to 
      examine if TEE adjusted for age, sex, fat-free mass, and fat mass is associated with 
      changes in weight or body composition. Here, we report that repeatability of TEE is 
      high for adults, but not children. Bivariate Bayesian mixed models show no among or 
      within-individual correlation between body composition (fat mass or percentage) and 
      unadjusted TEE in adults. For adults aged 20-60 y (N = 267; time interval: 
      7.4 ± 12.2 weeks), increases in adjusted TEE are associated with weight gain but not 
      with changes in body composition; results are similar for subjects with intervals >4 
      weeks (N = 53; 29.1 ± 12.8 weeks). This suggests low TEE is not a risk factor for, 
      and high TEE is not protective against, weight or body fat gain over the time 
      intervals tested.

TI  - Leg Fidgeting Improves Executive Function following Prolonged Sitting with a Typical 
      Western Meal: A Randomized, Controlled Cross-Over Trial.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19031357 [doi]
LID - 1357
AB  - Prolonged uninterrupted sitting and a typical Western meal, high in fat and refined 
      sugar, can additively impair cognitive and cerebrovascular functions. However, it is 
      unknown whether interrupting these behaviours, with a simple desk-based activity, 
      can attenuate the impairment. The aim of this study was to determine whether regular 
      leg fidgeting can off-set the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting following the 
      consumption of a typical Western meal, on executive and cerebrovascular function. 
      Using a randomized cross-over design, 13 healthy males consumed a Western meal and 
      completed 180-min of prolonged sitting with leg fidgeting of 1 min on/4 min off 
      (intervention [INT]) and without (control [CON]). Cognitive function was assessed 
      pre and post sitting using the Trail Maker Test (TMT) parts A and B. Common carotid 
      artery (CCA) blood flow, as an index of brain flow, was measured pre and post, and 
      cerebral (FP1) perfusion was measured continuously. For TMT B the CON trial 
      significantly increased (worsened) completion time (mean difference [MD] = 5.2 s, d 
      = 0.38), the number of errors (MD = 3.33, d = 0.68) and cognitive fatigue (MD = 
      0.73, d = 0.92). Compared to CON, the INT trial significantly improved completion 
      time (MD = 2.3 s, d = 0.97), and prevented declines in cognitive fatigue and a 
      reduction in the number of errors. No significant changes in cerebral perfusion or 
      CCA blood flow were found. Leg fidgeting for 1-min on/4-min off following a meal 
      high in fats and refined sugars attenuated the impairment in executive function. 
      This attenuation in executive function may not be caused by alterations in CCA blood 
      flow or cerebral perfusion.

TI  - Clinician education unlikely effective for guideline-adherent medication 
      prescription in low back pain: systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs.

LID - 101193
AB  - BACKGROUND: Effectiveness of implementing interventions to optimise 
      guideline-recommended medical prescription in low back pain is not well established. 
      METHODS: A systematic review and random-effects meta-analyses for dichotomous 
      outcomes with a Paule-Mandel estimator. Five databases and reference lists were 
      searched from inception to 4(th) August 2021. Randomised controlled/clinical trials 
      in adults with low back pain to optimise medication prescription were included. 
      Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool and GRADE were implemented. The review was registered 
      prospectively with PROSPERO (CRD42020219767). FINDINGS: Of 3352 unique records 
      identified in the search, seven studies were included and five were eligible for 
      meta-analysis (N=11339 participants). Six of seven studies incorporated clinician 
      education, three studies included audit/feedback components and one study 
      implemented changes in medical records systems. Via meta-analysis, we estimated a 
      non-significant odds-ratio of 0·94 (95% CI (0·77; 1.16), I² = 0%; n=5 studies, 
      GRADE: low) in favour of the intervention group. The main finding was robust to 
      sensitivity analyses. INTERPRETATION: There is low quality evidence that existing 
      interventions to optimise medication prescription or usage in back pain had no 
      impact. Peer-to-peer education alone does not appear to lead to behaviour change. 
      Organisational and policy interventions may be more effective. FUNDING: This work 
      was supported by internal institutional funding only.

TI  - Effects of Pre/Probiotic Supplementation on Breast Milk Levels of TGF-b1, TGF-b2, 
      and IgA: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized-Controlled Trial.
PG  - 22-32
LID - 10.1089/bfm.2021.0204 [doi]
AB  - Background: Previous studies have proposed that the maternal intake of 
      pre/probiotics may affect the immune composition of breast milk. Nevertheless, the 
      available findings are contradictory. This meta-analysis aimed to examine the impact 
      of maternal supplementation with pre/probiotics on the levels of total 
      immunoglobulin A (IgA), secretory IgA (SIgA), transforming growth factor beta 1 
      (TGF-β1), and TGF-2 in breast milk. Methods: PubMed and Scopus were systematically 
      searched using a comprehensive search strategy for eligible randomized-controlled 
      trials published up to February 2021. A random-effects model was applied to pool 
      weighted mean difference and 95% confidence interval (CI) as effect size. Cochran's 
      Q statistic and the I2 statistic were used to measure the between-study variance. 
      Egger's regression test was used to assess publication bias. Results: A total of 12 
      different studies, with a total sample size of 1722 individuals (probiotic group: 
      858, placebo group: 864), were included in this meta-analysis. In the overall 
      analysis, compared with placebo, maternal supplementation with pre/probiotics had no 
      significant effect on concentrations of total IgA, SIgA, TGF-β1, and TGF-β2 in the 
      breast milk. In the subgroup analysis, pre/probiotics did not affect total IgA, 
      TGF-β1, and TGF-β2 in both colostrum/transitional and mature milk. However, a 
      significant increase in SIgA was found in colostrum/transitional milk following 
      pre/probiotic administration (WMD = 19.33, 95% CI: 0.83-37.83; p = 0.04), without 
      evidence for remarkable heterogeneity (I(2) = 0.0, p = 0.57). Conclusions: Maternal 
      supplementation with pre/probiotics may increase SIgA in colostrum/transitional 
      milk, without any effect on total IgA, TGF-β1, and TGF-β2.

TI  - Volume Reduction: Which Dose is Sufficient to Retain Resistance Training Adaptations 
      in Older Women?
PG  - 68-76
LID - 10.1055/a-1502-6361 [doi]
AB  - We compared the effects of different resistance training (RT) volume reduction 
      strategies on muscular strength and lean soft-tissue (LST) in older women. 
      Fifty-seven physically independent women (>60 years) performed a 20-week 
      pre-conditioning phase of a standardized whole-body RT program (eight exercises, 
      three sets, 8-12 repetitions, three sessions a week), and were then randomly 
      assigned to one of the following conditions: reduced volume for a single set (RV1, 
      n=20) or two sets (RV2, n=19), or maintained volume of three sets (MV, n=18) for 8 
      weeks (specific training phase). Muscular strength in the chest press, leg 
      extension, and preacher curl exercises was determined by one-repetition maximum 
      tests. A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry device was used to estimate LST. An 
      increase in muscular strength (16.3-32.1%) and LST (3.2-7.9%) was observed after the 
      pre-conditioning phase. There was an increase in chest press for all groups 
      (9.4-16.7%) after the specific training phase. In contrast, only MV increased 
      significantly in the leg extension (4.4%). No between-group differences were 
      revealed for LST in the specific training phase. Our results suggest that reduced RT 
      volume from three to one set per exercise for 8 weeks seems sufficient to retain 
      neuromuscular adaptations in older women.

TI  - The Association between Consumption of Dairy-Originated Digestion Resistant and 
      Bioactive Peptides and Breast Cancer Risk: A Case-Control Study.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1080/01635581.2021.2009884 [doi]
AB  - Bioactive peptides (BPs) content of dairy products is suggested to be a significant 
      ingredient for reducing breast cancer (BC) risk. There is no observational study 
      regarding the correlation between BPs and the risk of chronic disease because BPs' 
      content of food items has not been evaluated in any study. The goal of the current 
      study was to assess the association of dairy-originated BPs with BC risk. One 
      hundred thirty-four women with BC and 267 cancer-free controls were selected from 
      referral hospitals in Tehran, Iran. The development of an in-silico model for 
      estimation of the bioactive and digestion-resistant peptides content of dairy 
      products was done in our previous research. The risk assessment for BPs and BC 
      association was performed across the tertiles of the peptide's intake. Odds ratios 
      (OR) were calculated by logistic regression. The negative association of all 
      bioactive and digestion-resistant peptides except for peptides with high 
      hydrophilicity and low bioactivity was seen in all models. In PR-negative subjects 
      only the association of total dairy intake (OR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.26-1.45; P (for 
      trend): 0.276), peptides with low bioactivity (OR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.16-1.02; P (for 
      trend): 0.0.052), antidiabetic peptides (OR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.17-1.05; P (for trend): 
      0.0.062) and di-peptides (OR: 0.42; 95% CI: 0.17-1.05; P (for trend): 0.0.062) were 
      not significant in the final model. Also, no significant association between 
      ER-negative subjects and total dairy intake (OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.16-1.07; P (for 
      trend): 0.0.068) was noted. Our findings deduced that milk-derived BPs negatively 
      associate with the risk of ER/PR/HER2 negative BC among Iranian women.Supplemental

AB  - The purpose was to investigate the effects of CYP1A2 -163C > A polymorphism on the 
      effects of acute caffeine (CAF) supplementation on anaerobic power in trained males. 
      Sixteen trained males (age: 21.6 ± 7.1 years; height: 179.7 ± 5.6 cm; body mass: 
      72.15 ± 6.8 kg) participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo (PLA) controlled 
      crossover design. Participants supplemented with CAF (6 mg/kg of body mass) and an 
      isovolumetric PLA (maltodextrin) in random order and separated by 7 days, before an 
      all-out 30-s anaerobic cycling test to determine peak, average, and minimum power 
      output, and fatigue index. Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted to identify 
      each participants CYP1A2 genotype. Six participants expressed AA homozygote and 10 
      expressed C alleles. There was a treatment by genotype interaction for peak power 
      output (p = .041, η2 = .265, observed power = 0.552) with only those expressing AA 
      genotype showing improvement following CAF supplementation compared with PLA (CAF: 
      693 ± 108 watts vs. PLA: 655 ± 97 watts; p = .039), while no difference between 
      treatments was noted in those expressing C alleles (CAF: 614 ± 92 watts vs. PLA: 659 
      ± 144 watts; p = .135). There were no other interaction or main effects for average 
      or minimum power output, or fatigue index (p > .05). In conclusion, the ingestion of 
      6 mg/kg of CAF improved peak power output only in participants with the AA genotype 
      compared with PLA; however, expression of the CYP1A2 did not influence average or 
      minimum power output or fatigue index.

TI  - Early Wearing of Knee-Ankle-Foot Orthosis Improves Functional Prognosis in Patients 
      after Stroke.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Knee-ankle-foot orthosis (KAFO) is sometimes used for gait training in 
      stroke patients. The impact of the time of wearing KAFO on activities of daily 
      living (ADL) recovery has not been clarified. This study aimed to examine the 
      relationship between the days from onset to KAFO wearing and functional prognosis in 
      patients after stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective, observational 
      study was conducted with stroke patients who were prescribed a KAFO. Patients were 
      divided into early and delayed groups according to the median days from onset to 
      KAFO wearing. Baseline characteristics were evaluated at the initiation of KAFO 
      wearing. The primary outcome was the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) gain, 
      which was scored by the nurse at baseline and discharge. RESULTS: 112 participants 
      (mean age 67.9 ± 14.0 years, 51.8% male) were included. The time period measure from 
      day of onset to KAFO wearing for the early group was significantly shorter than the 
      delayed group (35.8 ± 6.6 days vs. 73.5 ± 28.9 days). The early group had a higher 
      FIM at discharge (84.9 ± 28.0% vs. 65.1 ± 29.0%, P < 0.001) and higher FIM gain 
      (36.9 ± 19.8% vs. 26.8 ± 22.3, P = 0.013) than did the delayed group. Multiple 
      regression analysis showed that the early group was associated with FIM gain 
      (coefficient = 8.607, P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Early wearing of KAFO, irrespective 
      of the difference in ADL at the time of KAFO wearing, may have a positive impact on 
      the improvement of ADL in patients after stroke.

      physical activity in postmenopausal women.
LID - 10.1152/ajpregu.00075.2021 [doi]
AB  - Activity-related energy expenditure (AEE) correlates with physical activity volume, 
      however; between-person differences in body size and walking economy (net V̇O(2)) 
      can influence AEE. The ratio of total energy expenditure (TEE) and resting energy 
      expenditure (REE) estimates physical activity level (PAL) relative to body mass - 
      yet does not account for variance in walking economy. The activity-related time 
      equivalent (ARTE(walk)) circumvents such constraints by adjusting for 
      individual-specific walking economy. Herein, we compared AEE, PAL and ARTE(walk) 
      index in a cohort (n = 81) of postmenopausal woman while examining possible 
      associations with biomarkers of cardio-metabolic health. Secondary analyses were 
      performed on postmenopausal women dichotomized above/below age-group 50(th) 
      percentile for body fat percent. TEE was reduced by 10% for the thermogenesis of 
      digestion wherein AEE was calculated by subtracting REE from adjusted-TEE. PAL was 
      calculated as the ratio of TEE / REE. AEE was divided by the mean net energy 
      expenditure of non-graded walking to calculate the ARTE(walk) index. Between-group 
      differences were not detected for AEE or PAL. However, the ARTE(walk) index revealed 
      participants with less adiposity were more physically active (258±149 vs. 198±115 
      min·day(-1); p=0.046; g=0.46). AEE and PAL did not correlate with cardiorespiratory 
      fitness or biomarkers of cardio-metabolic health. Cardiorespiratory fitness(r=0.32), 
      arterial elasticity (r=0.24), total cholesterol / HDL-c ratio (r=-0.22) and body 
      fat% (r=-0.24) were correlated with ARTE(walk). The ARTE(walk) index may offer 
      utility in detecting possible differences in physical activity volume among 
      postmenopausal women and appears better associated with cardio-metabolic biomarkers 
      compared to AEE or PAL.

TI  - Prehabilitation with wearables versus standard of care before major abdominal cancer 
      surgery: a randomised controlled pilot study (trial registration: NCT04047524).
PG  - 1008-1017
LID - 10.1007/s00464-021-08365-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prehabilitation aims to improve post-operative outcomes by enhancing 
      pre-operative fitness but is labour-intensive. This pilot study aimed to assess the 
      efficacy of a tri-modal prehabilitation programme delivered by smartwatches for 
      improving functional fitness prior to major abdominal cancer surgery. METHODS: A 
      single-centre, randomised controlled pilot study, in which 22 patients were 
      randomised to: (a) a prehabilitation group (n = 11), comprising of home-based 
      exercise, nutritional, and dietary advice delivered using a wrist-worn smartwatch 
      connected to a smartphone application; or (b) a control group (n = 11) receiving 
      usual care, with patients given a smartwatch as a placebo. Eligible participants had 
      over two weeks until planned surgery. The primary outcome was pre-operative physical 
      activity including 6-min walk test (6MWT) distance, with secondary outcomes 
      including change in body weight and hospital anxiety and depression score (HADS). 
      RESULTS: Recruitment was 67% of eligible patients, with groups matched for baseline 
      characteristics. The prehabilitation group engaged in more daily minutes of moderate 
      [25.1 min (95% CI 9.79-40.44) vs 13.1 min (95% CI 5.97-20.31), p = 0.063] and 
      vigorous physical activity [36.1 min (95% CI 21.24-50.90) vs 17.5 min (95% CI 
      5.18-29.73), p = 0.022] compared to controls. They also had significantly greater 
      improvements in 6MWT distance compared to controls [+ 85.6 m (95% CI, + 18.06 
      to + 153.21) vs + 13.23 m (95% CI - 6.78 to 33.23), p = 0.014]. HADS scores remained 
      unchanged from baseline in both groups. CONCLUSION: Prehabilitation in the 
      colorectal cancer care setting can be delivered using smartwatches and mobile 
      applications. Furthermore, this study provides early indicative evidence that such 
      technologies can improve functional capacity prior to surgery TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      NCT04047524.

TI  - Bone mineral density in response to increased energy intake in exercising women with 
      oligo/amenorrhea: The REFUEL randomized controlled trial.
LID - nqac044 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/nqac044 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Energy deficiency can result in menstrual disturbances and compromised 
      bone health in women, a condition known as the Female Athlete Triad. OBJECTIVE: The 
      REFUEL randomized controlled trial assessed the impact of increased energy intake on 
      bone health and menstrual function in exercising women with menstrual disturbances. 
      METHODS: Exercising women with oligo/amenorrhea were randomized to an intervention 
      group (Oligo/Amen+Cal, n=40, 21.3±0.5 yrs, 55.0±1.0kg, 20.4±0.3 kg/m2) who increased 
      energy intake 20-40% above baseline energy needs for 12 months or a control group 
      (Oligo/Amen Control, n=36, 20.7±0.5 yrs, 59.1±1.3kg, 21.3±0.4 kg/m2). Energy intake 
      and expenditure, metabolic and reproductive hormones, body composition, and areal 
      bone mineral density (aBMD) were assessed. RESULTS: The Oligo/Amen+Cal group 
      improved energy status (increased body mass (2.6±0.4 kg), body mass index (0.9±0.2 
      kg/m2), fat mass (2.0±0.3 kg), body fat percentage (2.7±0.4%), and insulin-like 
      growth factor 1 (37.4±14.6 ng/ml)) compared to the control group and experienced a 
      greater likelihood of menses (p<0.05). Total body and spine aBMD remained unchanged 
      (p>0.05). Both groups demonstrated decreased femoral neck aBMD at month 6 (-0.006 
      g/cm2, 95%CI: -0.011, -0.0002 time main effect p=0.043) and month 12 (-0.011 g/cm2, 
      95%CI: -0.021, -0.001, time main effect p=0.023). Both groups demonstrated a 
      decrease in total hip aBMD at month 6 (-0.006 g/cm2, 95%CI: -0.011, -0.002, time 
      main effect p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: Although higher dietary energy intake increased 
      weight, body fat and menstrual frequency, bone mineral density was not improved, 
      compared to the control group. The 12-month intervention may have been too short and 
      the increase in energy intake (∼352 kcal/day), while sufficient to increase 
      menstrual frequency, was insufficient to increase estrogen or improve aBMD. Future 
      research should refine the optimal nutritional and/or pharmacological 
      intervention(s) for the recovery of bone health in athletes and exercising women 
      with oligo/amenorrhea. Clinical Trial Registry Number: NCT00392873

      after prolonged running in men.
LID - 10.1152/japplphysiol.00374.2021 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to clarify 1) the influence of genetic polymorphisms in the 
      cytochrome P450 aromatase gene (CYP19A1) on circulating estradiol levels in men and 
      2) whether estrogen-related genetic polymorphisms, such as the CYP19A1 rs936306 and 
      estrogen receptor-α (ESR1) rs2234693 polymorphisms, predict exercise-induced muscle 
      damage. Serum estradiol levels were examined in young men (n = 167). In a different 
      cohort, serum creatine kinase (CK) activity, an index of skeletal muscle membrane 
      disruption, was analyzed in a 2-days ultramarathon race: baseline, after the first 
      day, and after the second day (114 males and 25 females). Genetic polymorphisms in 
      CYP19A1 rs936306 C/T and ESR1 rs2234693 T/C were analyzed using the TaqMan SNP 
      genotyping assay. Male subjects with the TT genotype of the CYP19A1 polymorphism 
      exhibited significantly higher serum estradiol levels than the C allele carriers. 
      Male runners had significantly higher post-race serum CK activity than female 
      runners. The change in the CK activity during the ultramarathon race was 
      significantly lower in male subjects with the CYP19A1 TT genotype than in those with 
      the CC+CT genotypes, and was correlated with the number of C alleles in ESR1 
      rs2234693 in male subjects. Furthermore, the genotype scores of these two 
      polymorphisms were significantly correlated with changes in serum CK activity during 
      race (r = ‒0.279, P = 0.003). The results of this study suggest that genetic 
      polymorphisms in CYP19A1 rs936306 influence serum estradiol levels in men, and 
      genetic polymorphisms in CYP19A1 and ESR1 are associated with serum CK activity in 
      men.

TI  - Single and Serial Carbohydrate Mouth Rinsing Do Not Improve Yo-Yo Intermittent 
      Recovery Test Performance in Soccer Players.
PG  - 22–29
LID - ijsnem.2021-0174 [pii]
LID - 10.1123/ijsnem.2021-0174 [doi]
AB  - Carbohydrate (CHO) mouth rinsing seems to improve performance in exercises lasting 
      30-60 min. However, its effects on intermittent exercise are unclear. It is also 
      unknown whether serial CHO mouth rinses can promote additional ergogenic effects 
      when compared with a single mouth rinse. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      effect of single and serial CHO mouth rinses on Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test 
      Level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1) performance in soccer players. In a randomized, crossover, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 12 male (18.9 ± 0.5 years) soccer players 
      performed eight serial mouth rinses under three different conditions: placebo 
      solution only (noncaloric juice), seven placebo mouth rinses plus a single CHO mouth 
      rinse (8% maltodextrin), or eight CHO mouth rinses (8-CHO). Following the final 
      mouth rinse, individuals performed the Yo-Yo IR1 test to evaluate the maximal 
      aerobic endurance performance measured via total distance covered. There were no 
      differences in Yo-Yo IR1 performance between sessions (p = .32; single CHO mouth 
      rinse (8% maltodextrin): 1,198 ± 289 m, eight CHO mouth rinses: 1,256 ± 253 m, 
      placebo: 1,086 ± 284 m). In conclusion, single and serial CHO mouth rinsing did not 
      improve performance during the Yo-Yo IR1 for soccer players. These data suggest that 
      CHO mouth rinsing is not an effective ergogenic strategy for intermittent exercise 
      performance irrespective of the number of rinses.

TI  - Evaluating intake levels of nutrients linked to non-communicable diseases in 
      Australia using the novel combination of food processing and nutrient profiling 
      metrics of the PAHO Nutrient Profile Model.
LID - 10.1007/s00394-021-02740-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate intake levels of nutrients linked to non-communicable 
      diseases in Australia using the novel combination of food processing and nutrient 
      profiling metrics of the PAHO Nutrient Profile Model. METHODS: Dietary intakes of 
      12,153 participants from the Australian Health Survey (2011-12) aged 2 + years were 
      evaluated. Food items reported during a 24 h recall were classified using the NOVA 
      system. The Pan-American Health Organization Nutrient Profile Model (PAHO NPM) was 
      applied to identify processed and ultra-processed products with excessive content of 
      critical nutrients. Differences in mean intakes and prevalence of excessive intakes 
      of critical nutrients for groups of the population whose diets were made up of 
      products with and without excessive content in critical nutrients were examined. 
      RESULTS: The majority of Australians consumed daily at least three processed and 
      ultra-processed products identified as excessive in critical nutrients according to 
      the PAHO NPM. Individuals consuming these products had higher intakes of free sugars 
      (β = 8.9), total fats (β = 11.0), saturated fats (β = 4.6), trans fats (β = 0.2), 
      and sodium (β = 1788 for adolescents and adults; β = 1769 for children 5-10 years; 
      β = 1319 for children aged < 5 years) (p ≤ 0.001 for all nutrients) than individuals 
      not consuming these foods. The prevalence of excessive intake of all critical 
      nutrients also followed the same trend. CONCLUSION: The PAHO NPM has shown to be a 
      relevant tool to predict intake levels of nutrients linked to non-communicable 
      diseases in Australia and, therefore, could be used to inform policy actions aimed 
      at increasing the healthiness of food environments.

TI  - Recovery following the extra-time period of soccer: practitioner perspectives and 
      applied practices.
PG  - 171-179
LID - 10.5114/biolsport.2022.104066 [doi]
AB  - Research has demonstrated that the extra-time (ET) period of soccer negatively 
      impacts recovery. However, it is not known to what extent recovery practices are 
      being adapted by practitioners following ET and where gaps exist between research 
      and practice. Therefore, this study explored soccer practitioner perceptions of 
      recovery practices following ET matches. A total of 72 practitioners from across 
      different levels of soccer and several countries completed a bespoke online survey. 
      Inductive content analysis of the responses identified five higher-order themes: 
      'conditioning', 'player monitoring', 'recovery practices', 'training', and 'future 
      research directions'. Mixed responses were received in relation to whether 
      practitioners condition players in preparation for ET, though 72% allowed players to 
      return to training based on fatigue markers following this additional 30-min period. 
      Sixty-three (88%) practitioners believed that ET delays the time-course of recovery, 
      with 82% highlighting that practices should be adapted following ET compared with a 
      typical 90-min match. Forty-nine practitioners (68%) reduce training loads and 
      intensities for up to 48 hr post ET matches, though training mostly recommences as 
      'normal' at 72 hr. Sixty-three (88%) practitioners believed that more research 
      should be conducted on recovery following ET, with 'tracking players physiological 
      and physical responses', 'nutritional interventions to accelerate recovery' and 
      'changes in acute injury-risk' being the three areas of research that practitioners 
      ranked as most important. These data suggest practitioners and coaches adjust 
      recovery practices following ET matches compared to 90 min. Further research on the 
      efficacy of recovery strategies following ET matches is required to inform applied 
      practice.

AB  - Child eating behaviours have consistently been linked to child weight status. Yet, 
      changes in child eating behaviours during early obesity treatment are rarely 
      evaluated. Psychometric evaluation of the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire 
      (CEBQ) is common, but results are sample-dependent and included items may not 
      capture the full range of the underlying traits. Rasch analysis can overcome these 
      disadvantages. The aim of this paper was to assess child eating behaviours measured 
      by the CEBQ after a 12-month obesity intervention applying the Rasch model for the 
      validation of the CEBQ. The Rasch-based fit statistics were applied in children from 
      two samples, Australian and Swedish (n = 1724). Changes in eating behaviours amongst 
      children aged 4-6 years were examined in the More and Less RCT for obesity treatment 
      (n = 177), which compared a parenting programme (with and without boosters) against 
      standard treatment. Parents completed the CEBQ at four time points over 12-months. 
      Linear mixed models were applied to estimate treatment effects on the CEBQ, refined 
      according to Rasch, over time. We found that the validity of CEBQ was confirmed 
      after removing 4 items (item fit statistics outside range 0.5-1.5). When the refined 
      CEBQ was used in the assessment of the RCT, there were no differences in parental 
      reports of changes in children's eating behaviours between the parenting programme 
      and standard treatment (group-by-time interactions p > 0.05). However, in the total 
      sample food approach behaviours decreased while fussy eating behaviours increased 
      (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the refined CEBQ proved to be a valid tool for examining 
      parent-reported child eating behaviours. Early obesity treatment may decrease eating 
      behaviours associated with higher child weight. Future research should address the 
      associations between changes in child weight status and eating behaviours.

TI  - Making every contact count: recognising obesity in paediatric and young adult 
      cardiology.
PG  - 77-82
LID - 10.1017/S1047951121001566 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: With increased survival, children with CHD are reaching adulthood, 
      however, obesity amongst this cohort is an emerging problem. Making every contact 
      count encourages clinicians to utilise contact to elicit behaviour change. The aim 
      of this work was to identify whether the body habitus of children classified as 
      obese was addressed during a clinical review. METHODS: A retrospective observational 
      cohort study was completed using a cardiology outpatient dataset from 2010 to 2019. 
      Inclusion criteria are all children with a body mass index z score classified as 
      obese (≥ 2 z scores). Individual electronic patient records were reviewed to 
      identify long-term anthropometric measures including (i) recognition of body 
      habitus, (ii) prescription of physical activity or dietary intervention, and (iii) 
      referral to a weight management programme or dietitian. RESULTS: From the cohort of 
      95 patients, 285 "obese clinical encounters" were identified, at the time of a 
      cardiology clinic attendance. Of those, obesity was acknowledged in 25 clinic 
      letters (8.65%), but only 8 used the correct terms "obese" or "obesity" (2.77%). 
      Action to tackle obesity was recorded in 9.3% of cases with a direct referral to a 
      dietitian being made on 3 occasions (1.04%). CONCLUSIONS: Body habitus is not being 
      routinely addressed by cardiologists caring for paediatric and young adult cardiac 
      patients. This study has recognised an alarmingly high incidence of missed 
      opportunities to make every contact count, to manage those with obesity and 
      associated risk factors.

TI  - Does stressful workplace characteristics moderate or confound the association 
      between occupational physical activity and elevated depressive symptoms? A large 
      study including 36,442 adults.
LID - S0165-0327(22)00162-8 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: We tested whether stressful workplace characteristics confound or 
      moderate the association between occupational physical activity and depressive 
      symptoms. METHOD: We used data of 36,442 employed adults (16,992 women), with a mean 
      age of 39.3±12.6y, from the 2013 Brazilian National Health Survey. Depressive 
      symptoms were assessed through the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (cut-point: ≥10). 
      Occupational physical activity was self-reported and classified using the cut-point 
      of 150 min/week and the highest quintile. Ten stressful workplace characteristics 
      (e.g. exposure to stress, noise, violence) were also self-reported dichotomously. 
      Logistic regression models were used considering the adjustment for potential 
      confounders . RESULTS: Most of the stressful workplace characteristics were 
      associated with elevated depressive symptoms (8 characteristics) and higher 
      occupational physical activity (9 characteristics). Although there were no 
      interactions in combined associations, we found that the association between 
      occupational physical activity and depressive symptoms consistently reduced after 
      adjusting for the cluster of positive screening for at least two stressful workplace 
      characteristics in men [highest quintile: OR(unadjusted:) 1.63 (95%CI 1.22-2.17) vs 
      OR(adjusted): 1.36 (1.08-1.91); ≥150min/week: OR(unadjusted): 1.43 (1.09-1.88) vs 
      OR(adjusted): 1.25 (0.95-1.64)], and women [highest quintile: OR(unadjusted): 2.15 
      1.73-2.66) vs OR(adjusted): 1.83 (1.47-2.29); ≥150min/week: OR(unadjusted): 2.11 
      (1.68-2.65) vs OR(adjusted): 1.80 (1.42-2.27)]. LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional 
      design limits the causal inference. CONCLUSIONS: Stressful work environment did not 
      moderate, but acted as confounders in the association between occupational physical 
      activity and elevated depressive symptoms and should be considered in future 
      studies.

TI  - Comparison of Leisure Time Physical Activities by Metabolic Syndrome Status among 
      Adolescents.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19031415 [doi]
LID - 1415
AB  - Background: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) increases the risk of premature morbidity and 
      mortality. Physical activity (PA) beneficially affects MetS; however, it is unclear 
      if PA types differ among adolescents 12-15 years old, according to their MetS 
      status. This study compared self-reported PA types by MetS status. Methods: Using 
      the 2015-2016 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) data, 664 
      adolescents self-reported PA in the past seven days. MetS status was assessed using 
      Ford's pediatric adaptation of the ATP-III adult criteria. Pearson chi-square and 
      t-tests were conducted to determine self-reported PA differences. Results: The 
      adolescents' mean age was 13.47 years (95% CIs; 13.04, 14.38) and 52.69% were male 
      (352). Twenty-seven (4.07%) adolescents were MetS positive. The prevalence of PA 
      engagement in the past seven days was similar for MetS-positive and -negative 
      adolescents (77.67% and 70.51%, respectively; p > 0.05). No significant differences 
      were observed for PA type by MetS status. MetS-positive adolescents reported higher 
      sedentary time (565.77 [438.99, 692.56] vs. 490.59 [377.86, 603.33] minutes per day, 
      respectively; p = 0239). Conclusions: Engagement in specific PA types does not 
      appear to differ by MetS status, but MetS-positive adolescents have significantly 
      higher sedentary time. PA promotion should target a variety of activities to 
      maximize the effectiveness of public health programs and interventions should target 
      reducing sedentary time.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a pregnancy complication 
      associated with short- and long-term health consequences for mother and child. First 
      line treatment is diet and exercise but there is a recognized knowledge gap as to 
      what diet treatment is optimal. A healthy Nordic diet has been associated with 
      improved health but no studies in women with GDM exist. The New Nordic Diet (NND) is 
      an initiative with the purpose to develop a healthy Nordic diet including foods with 
      the potential to grow in Nordic countries; including fruit, berries, vegetables, 
      whole-grain cereal products, nuts, fish, and rapeseed oil. The purpose of the 
      intervention with new Nordic DIet in women with GestatiOnal diabetes mellitus 
      (iNDIGO) is to test if the NND compared with usual care improves glucose control in 
      women with GDM. METHODS: The iNDIGO study is a randomized parallel controlled trial 
      where 50 women with GDM will be randomized to either an NND or usual care for 
      14 days (30-32 weeks of gestation). Participants in the NND group will receive menus 
      and food bags containing foods to be consumed. Primary outcome is glycemic control 
      (time in target) measured using continuous glucose monitoring. Compliance to the 
      dietary intervention will be tested using dietary biomarkers and adherence 
      questionnaires. CONCLUSION: Diet treatment represents first line treatment in GDM 
      but it remains unclear what type of diets are effective. iNDIGO is an efficacy study 
      and will provide evidence as to whether a healthy Nordic diet can improve glucose 
      control in women with GDM. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov registration

TI  - Ergogenic potential of foods for performance and recovery: a new alternative in 
      sports supplementation? A systematic review.
PG  - 1480-1501
LID - 10.1080/10408398.2020.1844137 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, there have been studies in the literature reporting the ergogenic 
      effect of some different foods on sports performance. Given the reasonable number of 
      studies in which some food has shown improvement in some physiological variables 
      related to physical performance, a review is pertinent in order to produce a 
      compilation of these studies, providing new elements for athletes and coaches which 
      aim to optimize their performance. Thus, the objective of this work was to present a 
      systematic review of the findings regarding the potential ergogenic effect of food 
      for athletes. Researchers performed a double-blind research in Medline/PubMed 
      considering articles published until January 2019 which resulted in 71 articles. 
      Increased time until exhaustion, improved aerobic capacity and strength recovery 
      were the most commonly reported physical effects. In general, food showed equal or 
      superior ergogenic activity over supplements. Although the number of foods 
      investigated is reasonable, there is still no body of evidence for each studied 
      food, except beets. The current data support the possibility of certain foods being 
      able to enhance athletic performance, as well as serving as an energy source. 
      However, a larger volume of studies is needed to form a body of evidence on each of 
      these foods.

AB  - Long-chain n-3 fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) may prevent chemotherapy-induced 
      hyperlipidemia in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, 
      compliance could be a problem and intake-biomarker correlations may be affected by 
      bodyweight and blood transfusions. We assessed whole blood n-3 LCPUFA three times 
      during the first 83 days of treatment in six 1-17-year-old children with ALL, who 
      received 2.4-4.9 g/d n-3 LCPUFA depending on bodyweight. Mean compliance was 73%, 
      which resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in blood n-3 LCPUFA irrespective of blood 
      transfusions. The correlation between relative blood content of n-3 LCPUFA and 
      intake in g/d across the study period was strong (r=0.76, p=0.001). When n-3 LCPUFA 
      was expressed in absolute concentrations and intake per kg bodyweight the 
      correlation decreased (r=0.39, p=0.164) and was driven by baseline values. Thus, 
      relative content of n-3 LCPUFA in blood reflects fish oil compliance in children 
      with ALL despite blood transfusions and differences in bodyweight.

TI  - The association of sickle-cell trait with β-cell dysfunction and physical activity 
      in adults living with and without HIV in Tanzania.
LID - 10.1111/apm.13214 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to investigate sickle cell trait (SCT) associations with 
      physical activity, markers of insulin secretion and resistance, and glucose among 
      people living with HIV infection (PLWH), both antiretroviral therapy (ART) naïve and 
      experienced, and HIV-uninfected adults. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study 
      conducted in Mwanza, north-western Tanzania. We used data of 668 participants 
      attained from two sub-studies of CICADA study. RESULTS: Mean age was 40 (SD 11.5) 
      years, 402 (61.7 %) were females and 157 (24.1 %) had SCT. PLWH were 422 (64.7 %), 
      of these, 80 (18.9 %) were on ART. People with SCT had higher risk of having an 
      isolated β-cell dysfunction compared to those without SCT (RRR=1.82, CI: 1.10, 3.01, 
      P=0.02). People with SCT but without HIV infection had lower average acceleration on 
      the trunk longitudinal axis (ACCx) and higher level of self-reported physical 
      activity. 30 min oral glucose tolerance test among PLWH on ART was higher in those 
      with SCT compared to those without SCT. CONCLUSION: People with SCT are at higher 
      risk of having β-cell dysfunction and those with SCT on ART are at more risk of 
      developing diabetes. Future studies to investigate the interaction between SCT and 
      HIV/ART on risk of diabetes should be considered.

TI  - Daily Protein-Polyphenol Ingestion Increases Daily Myofibrillar Protein Synthesis 
      Rates and Promotes Early Muscle Functional Gains During Resistance Training.
LID - 10.1152/ajpendo.00328.2021 [doi]
AB  - Factors underpinning the time-course of resistance-type exercise training (RET) 
      adaptations are not fully understood. The present study hypothesized that consuming 
      a twice-daily protein-polyphenol beverage (PPB; n=15; age, 24 ± 1 years; BMI, 22.3 ± 
      0.7 kg·m(-2)) previously shown to accelerate recovery from muscle damage and 
      increase daily myofibrillar protein synthesis (MyoPS) rates would accelerate early 
      (10 sessions) improvements in muscle function and potentiate quadriceps volume and 
      muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) following 30 unilateral RET sessions in 
      healthy, recreationally active, adults. Versus isocaloric placebo (PLA; n=14; age, 
      25 ± 2 years; BMI, 23.9 ± 1.0 kg·m(-2)), PPB increased 48 h MyoPS rates after the 
      first RET session measured using deuterated water (2.01 ± 0.15 %·d(-1) vs. 1.51 ± 
      0.16 , respectively; P<0.05). Additionally, PPB increased isokinetic muscle function 
      over 10 sessions of training relative to the untrained control leg (%U) from 99.9 ± 
      1.8 pre-training to 107.2 ± 2.4 %U at session 10 (versus 102.6 ± 3.9 to 100.8 ± 2.4 
      %U at session 10 in PLA; interaction P<0.05). Pre-to-post-training, PPB increased 
      type II fCSA (PLA: 120.8 ± 8.2 to 109.5 ± 8.6 %U; PPB: 92.8 ± 6.2 to 108.4 ± 9.7 %U; 
      interaction P<0.05), but the gain in quadriceps muscle volume was similar between 
      groups. Similarly, PPB did not further increase peak isometric torque, muscle 
      function or MyoPS measured post-training. This suggests that although PPB increases 
      MyoPS and early adaptation, it may not influence longer term adaptations to 
      unilateral RET.

TI  - Characterizing patterns of dietary exposure using metabolomic profiles of human 
      biospecimens: a systematic review.
LID - nuab103 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/nutrit/nuab103 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Establishing diet-disease associations requires reliable assessment of 
      dietary intake. With the rapid advancement of metabolomics, its use in identifying 
      objective biomarkers of dietary exposure has substantially increased. OBJECTIVE: The 
      aim of our review was to systematically combine all observational studies linking 
      dietary intake patterns with metabolomic profiles of human biospecimens. DATA 
      SOURCES: Five databases were searched - MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and 
      Cochrane CENTRAL - to March 2020. DATA EXTRACTION: Of the 14 328 studies initially 
      screened, 35 observational studies that met the specified inclusion criteria were 
      included. DATA ANALYSIS: All reviewed studies indicated that metabolomic measures 
      were significantly correlated with dietary patterns, demonstrating the potential for 
      using objective metabolomic measures to characterize individuals' dietary intake. 
      However, similar dietary patterns did not always result in similar metabolomic 
      profiles across different study populations. CONCLUSION: Metabolomic profiles 
      reflect a multitude of factors, including diet, genetic, phenotypic, and 
      environmental influences, thereby providing a more comprehensive picture of the 
      impact of diet on metabolism and health outcomes. Further exploration of dietary 
      patterns and metabolomic profiles across different population groups is warranted.

TI  - The effect of cathodal transspinal direct current stimulation on tibialis anterior 
      stretch reflex components in humans.
PG  - 159-171

AB  - Spinal DC stimulation (tsDCS) shows promise as a technique for the facilitation of 
      functional recovery of motor function following central nervous system (CNS) lesion. 
      However, the network mechanisms that are responsible for the effects of tsDCS are 
      still uncertain. Here, in a series of experiments, we tested the hypothesis that 
      tsDCS increases the excitability of the long-latency stretch reflex, leading to 
      increased excitability of corticospinal neurons in the primary motor cortex. 
      Experiments were performed in 33 adult human subjects (mean age 28 ± 7 years/14 
      females). Subjects were seated in a reclining armchair with the right leg attached 
      to a footplate, which could be quickly plantarflexed (100 deg/s; 6 deg amplitude) to 
      induce stretch reflexes in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle at short (45 ms) and 
      longer latencies (90-95 ms). This setup also enabled measuring motor evoked 
      potentials (MEPs) and cervicomedullary evoked potentials (cMEPs) from TA evoked by 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electrical stimulation at the cervical 
      junction, respectively. Cathodal tsDCS at 2.5 and 4 mA was found to increase the 
      long-latency reflex without any significant effect on the short-latency reflex. 
      Furthermore, TA MEPs, but not cMEPs, were increased following tsDCS. We conclude 
      that cathodal tsDCS over lumbar segments may facilitate proprioceptive transcortical 
      reflexes in the TA muscle, and we suggest that the most likely explanation of this 
      facilitation is an effect on ascending fibers in the dorsal columns.

TI  - Impact of timing of PERT on gastrointestinal symptoms in Danish children and 
      adolescents with CF.
PG  - 432-439
LID - 10.1111/apa.16143 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are often reported by CF patients. Despite a 
      proven relation to exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (PI), it remains unclear 
      whether GI symptoms are related to the timing of pancreatic enzyme replacement 
      therapy (PERT). Whereas most international recommendations suggest administration of 
      PERT at the beginning of meals, it has not been studied whether such a proceeding is 
      associated with lower burden of symptoms. METHODS: Thirty CF patients aged 
      0-17 years of age with PI were randomised to four weeks of PERT prior to meals 
      followed by four weeks of PERT after meals or vice versa. Using the CF-specific 
      validated CFAbd-Score, abdominal pain, dysfunctional bowel habits and Quality of 
      Life (QoL) related to GI symptoms were assessed in relation to the timing of PERT. 
      Data were analysed using a linear mixed model. RESULTS: There was no significant 
      difference regarding abdominal pain, bowel habits or QoL related to GI symptoms when 
      timing of PERT was changed from prior to after meals. CONCLUSION: No significant 
      difference was found when administration mode of PERT changed from prior to after 
      meals or vice versa. However, after an individual assessment, some patients may 
      profit from changing administration mode of PERT from prior to after meals.

TI  - The cost effectiveness of personalized dietary advice to increase protein intake in 
      older adults with lower habitual protein intake: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 505-520
LID - 10.1007/s00394-021-02675-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the cost effectiveness of dietary advice to increase protein 
      intake on 6-month change in physical functioning among older adults. METHODS: In 
      this multicenter randomized controlled trial, 276 community-dwelling older adults 
      with a habitual protein intake < 1.0 g/kg adjusted body weight (aBW)/d were randomly 
      assigned to either Intervention 1; advice to increase protein intake to ≥ 1.2 g/kg 
      aBW/d (PROT, n = 96), Intervention 2; similar advice and in addition advice to 
      consume protein (en)rich(ed) foods within half an hour after usual physical activity 
      (PROT + TIMING, n = 89), or continue the habitual diet with no advice (CON, n = 91). 
      Primary outcome was 6-month change in 400-m walk time. Secondary outcomes were 
      6-month change in physical performance, leg extension strength, grip strength, body 
      composition, self-reported mobility limitations and quality of life. We evaluated 
      cost effectiveness from a societal perspective. RESULTS: Compared to CON, a positive 
      effect on walk time was observed for PROT;  - 12.4 s (95%CI,  - 21.8 to  - 2.9), and 
      for PROT + TIMING;  - 4.9 s (95%CI,  - 14.5 to 4.7). Leg extension strength 
      significantly increased in PROT (+ 32.6 N (95%CI, 10.6-54.5)) and PROT + TIMING 
      (+ 24.3 N (95%CI, 0.2-48.5)) compared to CON. No significant intervention effects 
      were observed for the other secondary outcomes. From a societal perspective, PROT 
      was cost effective compared to CON. CONCLUSION: Dietary advice to increase protein 
      intake to ≥ 1.2 g/kg aBW/d improved 400-m walk time and leg strength among older 
      adults with a lower habitual protein intake. From a societal perspective, PROT was 
      considered cost-effective compared to CON. These findings support the need for 
      re-evaluating the protein RDA of 0.8 g/kg BW/d for older adults. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      The trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03712306). Date of 
      registration: October 2018. Registry name: The (Cost) Effectiveness of Increasing 
      Protein Intake on Physical Functioning in Older Adults. Trial Identifier: 
      NCT03712306.

TI  - The efficacy of a comprehensive bone health program in maintaining bone mineral 
      density in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer treated with 
      endocrine therapy: real-world data.
LID - 10.1007/s11845-021-02897-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors (AI) are the gold standard treatment option for 
      hormone-sensitive postmenopausal women with breast cancer. Several studies had 
      documented the accelerated bone loss associated with AI. AIMS: In this study, we 
      present real-world data describing the efficacy of implementing a comprehensive bone 
      health program to maintain bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal patients 
      with early-stage breast cancer treated with AI. METHODS: A comprehensive bone health 
      program that includes counseling, exercise, nutritional advice, vitamin D 
      supplements and, when needed, intravenous bisphosphonate infusion was implemented 
      following the initiation of endocrine therapy with AI. Postmenopausal women with 
      hormone-sensitive, early-stage breast cancer treated with endocrine therapy using AI 
      were retrospectively identified. All patients had BMD measurements before and at 
      least 1 year after ET initiation. RESULTS: A total of 210 patients were included, 
      median (range) age 67 (43-86) years. At baseline, osteoporosis was documented in 38 
      (18.1%) and osteopenia in 101 (48.1%) patients. Despite the known negative effect of 
      AI, 32 (84.2%) patients with baseline osteoporosis and 69 (68.3%) of those with 
      osteopenia, had a stable or better BMD. On the other hand, 41 (57.7%) of those with 
      normal baseline BMD had a drop in their follow up BMD, p < 0.001. Vertebral 
      fractures were reported in 3 (11.1%) patients with osteoporosis compared to none in 
      patients with normal BMD, p = 0.021. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the known negative effect 
      of ET on bone health of breast cancer patients, implementing a comprehensive bone 
      health program stabilized or improved BMD.

TI  - An Earlier First Meal Timing Associates with Weight Loss Effectiveness in A 12-Week 
      Weight Loss Support Program.
LID - 10.3390/nu14020249 [doi]
LID - 249
AB  - Recent studies have reported that meal timing may play an important role in weight 
      regulation, however it is unknown whether the timing of meals is related to the 
      amount of weight loss. This study aimed to examine the relationship between indices 
      of meal timing and weight loss during weight loss intervention in adults. A 12-week 
      weight loss support program was conducted for 97 adults (age: 47.6 ± 8.3 years, BMI: 
      25.4 ± 3.7 kg/m(2)). After the program, body weight decreased by -3.0 ± 2.7%. Only 
      the start of the eating window was positively correlated with the weight change rate 
      in both sexes (men: r = 0.321, p = 0.022; women: r = 0.360, p = 0.014). The 
      participants were divided into two groups based on the start of the eating window as 
      follows: the early group (6:48 ± 0:21 AM) and the late group (8:11 ± 1:05 AM). The 
      weight loss rate in the early group was significantly higher (-3.8 ± 2.7%) than that 
      in the late group (-2.2 ± 2.5%). The present results showed that the start of the 
      early eating window was associated with weight loss and suggested paying attention 
      to meal timing when doing weight loss.

TI  - Effects of changing from a diet with saturated fat to a diet with n-6 
      polyunsaturated fat on the serum metabolome in relation to cardiovascular disease 
      risk factors.
LID - 10.1007/s00394-021-02796-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Replacing saturated fatty acids (SFA) with polyunsaturated fatty acids 
      (PUFA) is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. Yet, the changes 
      in the serum metabolome after this replacement is not well known. Therefore, the 
      present study aims to identify the metabolites differentiating diets where six 
      energy percentage SFA is replaced with PUFA and to elucidate the association of 
      dietary metabolites with cardiometabolic risk markers. METHODS: In an 8-week, 
      double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, 99 moderately hyper-cholesterolemic 
      adults (25-70 years) were assigned to a control diet (C-diet) or an experimental 
      diet (Ex-diet). Both groups received commercially available food items with 
      different fatty acid compositions. In the Ex-diet group, products were given where 
      SFA was replaced mostly with n-6 PUFA. Fasting serum samples were analysed by 
      untargeted ultra-performance liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry 
      (UPLC-HRMS). Pre-processed data were analysed by double cross-validated Partial 
      Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) to detect features differentiating the 
      two diet groups. RESULTS: PLS-DA differentiated the metabolic profiles of the 
      Ex-diet and the C-diet groups with an area under the curve of 0.83. The Ex-diet 
      group showed higher levels of unsaturated phosphatidylcholine plasmalogens, an 
      unsaturated acylcarnitine, and a secondary bile acid. The C-diet group was 
      characterized by odd-numbered phospholipids and a saturated acylcarnitine. The 
      Principal Component analysis scores of the serum metabolic profiles characterizing 
      the diets were significantly associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 
      total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels but not with glycaemia. CONCLUSION: The 
      serum metabolic profiles confirmed the compliance of the participants based on their 
      diet-specific metabolome after replacing SFA with mostly n-6 PUFA. The participants' 
      metabolic profiles in response to the change in diet were associated with 
      cardiovascular disease risk markers. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov 
      as NCT01679496 on September 6th 2012.

TI  - The estimated prevalence of no reported dementia-related diagnosis in older 
      Americans living with possible dementia by healthcare utilization.
PG  - 359-365
LID - 10.1007/s40520-021-01980-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Screening for dementia in relevant healthcare settings may help in 
      identifying low cognitive functioning for comprehensive cognitive assessments and 
      subsequent dementia treatment after diagnosis. AIMS: This study sought to estimate 
      the prevalence of no reported dementia-related diagnosis in a 
      nationally-representative sample of older Americans with a cognitive impairment 
      consistent with dementia (CICD) by healthcare utilization. METHODS: The unweighted 
      analytical sample included 1514 Americans aged ≥ 65 years that were identified as 
      having a CICD without history of stroke, cancers, neurological conditions, or brain 
      damage who participated in at least one-wave of the 2010-2016 waves of the Health 
      and Retirement Study. An adapted Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status assessed 
      cognitive functioning. Those with scores ≤ 6 had a CICD. Dementia-related diagnosis 
      was self-reported. Respondents indicated if they visited a physician, received home 
      healthcare, or experienced an overnight nursing home stay in the previous two years. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of no reported dementia-related diagnosis in persons with a 
      CICD who visited a physician was 89.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 85.4%-93.1%). 
      Likewise, the prevalence of no reported diagnosis in those with a CICD who received 
      home healthcare was 84.3% (CI: 75.1-90.5%). For persons with a CICD that had an 
      overnight nursing home stay, the prevalence of no reported dementia-related 
      diagnosis was 83.0% (CI: 69.1-91.4%). DISCUSSION: Although the prevalence of no 
      reported dementia-related diagnosis in individuals with a CICD differed across 
      healthcare settings, the prevalence was generally high nonetheless. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      recommend increased awareness and efforts be given to dementia screenings in various 
      clinical settings.

AB  - This study examined if field-expedient physical fitness/performance assessments 
      predicted performance during a simulated direct-fire engagement. Healthy subjects 
      (n = 33, age = 25.7 ± 7.0 years) completed upper- and lower-body strength and power 
      assessments and a 3-min all-out running test to determine critical velocity. 
      Subjects completed a simulated direct-fire engagement that consisted of marksmanship 
      with cognitive workload assessment and a fire-and-move drill (16 × 6-m sprints) 
      while wearing a combat load. Susceptibility to enemy fire was modelled on average 
      sprint duration during the fire-and-move drill. Stepwise linear regression 
      identified predictors for the performance during the simulated direct-fire 
      engagement. Critical velocity (β = -0.30, p < 0.01) and standing broad jump (β = 
      -0.67, p < 0.001) predicted susceptibility to enemy fire (R(2) = 0.74, p < 0.001). 
      All predictors demonstrated poor relationships with marksmanship accuracy and 
      cognitive performance. These data demonstrate the importance of exercise tolerance 
      and lower-body power during simulated direct-fire engagements and provide potential 
      targets for interventions to monitor and enhance performance and support soldier 
      survivability. Practitioner Summary: This study identified field-expedient physical 
      fitness/performance predictors of a simulated direct-fire engagement which evaluated 
      susceptibility to enemy fire, marksmanship, and cognitive performance. Our findings 
      suggest that high-intensity exercise tolerance and lower-body power are key 
      determinants of performance that predicted susceptibility to enemy fire.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Food insecurity risk increases among disaster-struck individuals. The 
      authors employed the social determinants of health framework to (1) describe the 
      characteristics and food-seeking behaviors of individuals coping with the 
      coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and (2) evaluate the relationship between these 
      factors and food insecurity risk. DESIGN: A cross-sectional Qualtrics survey was 
      administered May 14-June 8, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Adults living in New York were 
      recruited online (n = 410). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Food insecurity risk. ANALYSIS: 
      Logistic regression analyses were conducted using a model-building approach. 
      RESULTS: A total of 38.5% of the sample was considered food insecure after the 
      coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. The final model revealed that not knowing where 
      to find help to acquire food, reporting that more food assistance program benefits 
      would be helpful, being an essential worker, having general anxiety, and being a 
      college student were risk factors for food insecurity regardless of demographic 
      characteristics. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: With more individuals experiencing 
      food insecurity for the first time, there is a need for enhanced outreach and 
      support. The findings complement emerging research on food insecurity risk during 
      and after the pandemic and can help to inform food assistance programs and policies.

TI  - Association of public physical activity facilities and participation in community 
      programs with leisure-time physical activity: does the association differ according 
      to educational level and income?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim was to analyze the association of the presence of public 
      physical activity (PA) facilities and participation in public PA programs with 
      leisure-time PA, with an emphasis on the moderating role of educational level and 
      income. METHODS: We used data of 88,531 adults (46,869 women), with a mean age of 
      47.2 ± 17.1y, from the 2019 Brazilian National Health Survey. Leisure-time PA 
      (dichotomized considering 150 min/week), the presence of a public PA facility near 
      the household (yes or no), participation in public PA programs (yes or no), 
      educational level (divided into quintiles) and per capita income (divided into 
      quintiles) were all self-reported through interviews. Adjusted logistic regression 
      models were used for the analyses. RESULTS: The presence of public PA facilities 
      near the household and the participation in public PA programs were associated with 
      higher leisure-time PA among all quintiles of income and educational level. However, 
      multiplicative interactions revealed that participating in PA programs [Quintile 
      (Q)1: OR: 13.99; 95%CI: 6.89-28.38 vs. Q5: OR: 3.48; 95%CI: 2.41-5.01] and the 
      presence of public PA facilities near the household (Q1: OR: 3.07; 95%CI: 2.35-4.01 
      vs. Q5: OR: 1.38; 95%CI: 1.22-1.55) were more associated with higher odds of being 
      active in the leisure-time among the lowest quintile of educational level. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The presence of public PA facilities and participation in public PA 
      programs are environmental correlates that may be relevant for designing effective 
      public health interventions to reduce social inequalities in leisure-time PA among 
      adults in low-income areas.

TI  - Prevalence and factors associated with gynoid lipodystrophy in Brazilian adolescent 
      girls: a cross-sectional study.
LID - 10.1111/ijd.16061 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gynoid lipodystrophy (GLD), or female cellulitis, is a chronic 
      multifactorial disorder characterized by the irregular appearance of the skin 
      surface on the thighs and gluteal regions, which affects 80-90% of women after 
      puberty. No curative treatments are available, and there is a paucity of 
      epidemiological studies related to its prevalence, quality of life impact, and risk 
      factors. We aimed to identify the prevalence and factors associated with the 
      development of GLD in Brazilian adolescent girls. METHODS: A cross-sectional study 
      examined adolescent girls from São Paulo, Brazil. The explored factors were grouped: 
      familial history, gynecological and hormonal characteristics, exercise practice, 
      nutrition and diet, anthropometric measures, body mass index, and body composition, 
      according to GLD severity assessed through multivariate hierarchic statistics. 
      RESULTS: In total, 184 girls, aged from 12 to 18 years, were included in the study. 
      The overall prevalence of GLD was 77.7% (CI 95% 71.7-82.1%); moderate and severe 
      categories of GLD occurred in 56.5% (CI 95% 48.9-62.5%) of the sample. An impact on 
      the quality of life was identified in 39.7% of the girls. GLD was independently 
      associated with higher body mass index, early menarche, higher carbohydrate intake, 
      lower water consumption, menstrual irregularity, familial report of GLD, and less 
      exercise practice. CONCLUSION: Gynoid lipodystrophy is a multifactorial disorder; 
      its onset in adolescent girls is associated with familial occurrence, body 
      composition, diet habits, exercise, and hormonal factors. These results support 
      further interventions for GLD prevention and treatment.

TI  - Fecal microbiota relationships with childhood obesity: A scoping comprehensive 
      review.
PG  - e13394
LID - 10.1111/obr.13394 [doi]
AB  - Childhood obesity is a costly burden in most regions with relevant and adverse 
      long-term health consequences in adult life. Several studies have associated 
      excessive body weight with a specific profile of gut microbiota. Different factors 
      related to fecal microorganism abundance seem to contribute to childhood obesity, 
      such as gestational weight gain, perinatal diet, antibiotic administration to the 
      mother and/or child, birth delivery, and feeding patterns, among others. This review 
      reports and discusses diverse factors that affect the infant intestinal microbiota 
      with putative or possible implications on the increase of the obesity childhood 
      rates as well as microbiota shifts associated with excessive body weight in 
      children.

TI  - Global Trends in Scientific Research on Pediatric Obesity.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19031251 [doi]
LID - 1251
AB  - (1) Introduction: The aim of this study was to analyze scientific production, 
      collaboration among countries, and research topics focusing on pediatric obesity. 
      (2) Methods: The papers that were included in the study were retrieved from the Web 
      of Science Core Collection from Clarivate Analytics. A bibliometric analysis of 
      several focuses, including journals of publication, subject categories, most 
      frequent author keywords, and journal impact factors, was conducted. Social network 
      analysis was used to recognize collaboration groups between countries and the 
      co-occurrences of author keywords. (3) Results: A total of 12,171 research articles 
      were published in 2036 journals classified under a variety of subject areas, with 
      pediatrics (27.7%), nutrition and dietetics (18.5%), and public environmental and 
      occupational health (18.4%) accounting for the most frequent study areas, and 
      Pediatric Obesity (309), the International Journal of Obesity (299), and BMC Public 
      Health being the most productive journals. The main challenges identified for 
      pediatric obesity include general topics such as physical activity, nutrition, diet, 
      and prevention as well as other more specific challenges such as metabolic syndrome, 
      insulin resistance, eating behavior, and cardiovascular diseases. (4) Conclusions: 
      We observed a growth rate in the number of published articles of 59.8%, which serves 
      as evidence of the importance of the topic. The number of funded papers also doubled 
      from 2010 to 2019. There has been significant global collaboration on the topic, 
      with countries across five continents being involved. The results of the thematic 
      analysis reveal the importance of exercise and nutrition-related topics along with 
      specialized health terms and terms related to public health.

TI  - Velocity-Based Resistance Training on 1-RM, Jump and Sprint Performance: A 
      Systematic Review of Clinical Trials.
LID - 10.3390/sports10010008 [doi]
LID - 8
AB  - Weight resistance training (RT) has been shown to positively influence physical 
      performance. Within the last two decades, a methodology based on monitoring RT 
      through movement velocity (also called velocity-based resistance training, VBRT) has 
      emerged. The aim of this PRISMA-based systematic review was to evaluate the effect 
      of VBRT programs on variables related to muscle strength (one-repetition maximum, 
      1-RM), and high-speed actions (vertical jump, and sprint performance) in trained 
      subjects. The search for published articles was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, SPORT 
      Discus/EBSCO, OVID, Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE databases using Boolean 
      algorithms independently. A total of 22 studies met the inclusion criteria of this 
      systematic review (a low-to-moderate overall risk of bias of the analyzed studies 
      was detected). VBRT is an effective method to improve 1-RM, vertical jump and 
      sprint. According to the results of the analyzed studies, it is not necessary to 
      reach high muscle failure in order to achieve the best training results. These 
      findings reinforce the fact that it is possible to optimize exercise adaptations 
      with less fatigue. Future studies should corroborate these findings in female 
      population.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and is 
      the leading cause of death in the United States. Cardiac rehabilitation, or cardiac 
      rehab, is a complex, interprofessional intervention customized to individual 
      patients with various cardiovascular diseases such as ischemic heart disease, heart 
      failure, and myocardial infarctions, or patients who have undergone cardiovascular 
      interventions such as coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass 
      grafting. Cardiac rehabilitation programs aim to limit the psychological and 
      physiological stresses of CVD, reduce the risk of mortality secondary to CVD, and 
      improve cardiovascular function to help patients achieve their highest quality of 
      life possible. Accomplishing these goals is the result of improving overall cardiac 
      function and capacity, halting or reversing the progression of atherosclerotic 
      disease, and increasing the patient's self-confidence through gradual conditioning. 
      Several organizations, including the American Heart Association (AHA), The American 
      Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation (AACVPR), and the Agency 
      for Health Care Policy and Research, agree that a comprehensive cardiac 
      rehabilitation program should contain specific core components. These components 
      should optimize cardiovascular risk reduction, reduce disability, encourage active 
      and healthy lifestyle changes, and help maintain those healthy habits after 
      rehabilitation is complete. Cardiac rehabilitation programs should focus on: Patient 
      assessment nutritional counseling. Weight management. Blood pressure management. 
      Lipid management. Diabetes management. Tobacco cessation. Psychosocial management. 
      Physical activity counseling. Exercise training.

TI  - Poor anaerobic threshold and VO(2) max recorded during cardiopulmonary exercise 
      testing (CPET) prior to cytoreductive surgery in advanced (stage 3/4) ovarian cancer 
      (AOC) is associated with suboptimal cytoreduction but does not preclude maximum 
      effort cytoreduction.
PG  - 294-300

AB  - This study assessed Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) in predicting 
      oncological outcomes, post-operative recovery and complications in advanced ovarian 
      cancer (AOC) cytoreductive surgery. We reviewed all patients who had CPET prior to 
      AOC cytoreductive surgery with evidence of upper abdominal disease on preoperative 
      imaging at the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton (UHDB) between August 2016 
      and July 2019. Patients were stratified by AT and maximum VO(2) levels. 43 patients 
      were identified. AT showed no relationship with major complications. 100% of 
      patients in the AT ≥11 group received R0 (n = 21, 91.30%), or R1 (n = 2, 8.70%) 
      cytoreduction, whereas in the AT <11 group, only 75.00% achieved and R0 or R1 
      resection (p = .02). Surgical complexity was higher in the AT ≥11 group (p = .001) 
      and the VO(2) ≥15 group (p = .0006). No other correlations were seen between AT or 
      VO(2) max and complications or readmissions. No difference in overall survival was 
      seen if R0 resection was achieved.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this 
      subject? CPET testing allows pre-operative assessment of functional capacity to 
      generate variables that can be used as a risk-stratification tool for major surgery. 
      Whilst CPET testing has been shown to predict morbidity in non-gynaecological 
      surgery, it remains unproven in cytoreductive surgery for ovarian cancer surgery 
      despite being increasingly utilised.What do the results of study add? Our data 
      suggest that CPET testing does not predict complication rates or survival in AOC. 
      Patients with poor CPET performance are more likely to receive suboptimal 
      cytoreductive outcomes from surgery.What are the implications of these findings for 
      clinical practice and/or further research? CPET results should not be used to 
      discount patients from cytoreductive surgery further research should address the 
      interplay with nutrition, haematological markers, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and CPET 
      performance.

TI  - Posture and Muscle Activity during Waste Collection Work.
PG  - 119-123
LID - 10.1093/annweh/wxab022 [doi]
AB  - The musculoskeletal load in waste collection has been examined through simulated 
      assessment of pulling and pushing bins as well as lifting and throwing rubbish bags. 
      With the onset of mechanization, many of these tasks do not exist and workers are 
      faced with other loads not previously assessed. The purpose of this study was to 
      quantify the postures and muscle activity during mechanized waste collection work. 
      Three subtasks of mechanized waste collection were identified, namely driving, bin 
      collection, and egress and access of the vehicle. Spinal, shoulder, and upper limb 
      kinematics along with surface electromyography from three muscles were collected 
      during these tasks in a typical work shift. During driving and bin collection, 
      participants adopted a head-extended, torso forward-flexed posture with frequent 
      rotations of the head and neck. Egress and access of the vehicle produced 
      substantially larger ranges of movement compared with driving and bin collection. 
      The forward-flex, sitting posture can increase the risk of low back pain if there 
      are undulations in the terrain and if this posture is adopted for prolonged periods. 
      The frequent head and neck rotations can increase the incidence and severity of neck 
      pain. Prolonged driving has been linked with an increased cardiometabolic risk and 
      egress and access has increased risk of trips and falls from a height. Managers of 
      waste collection workers should consider implementing interventions to reduce the 
      exposure of this important workforce to the deleterious demands of their work.

TI  - A systematic review of food waste audit methods in hospital foodservices: 
      development of a consensus pathway food waste audit tool.
PG  - 68-80
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12928 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To understand, monitor and compare the scope of food waste in hospital 
      foodservices, it is essential to measure food waste using a standardised method. The 
      aims of this systematic review were to: (i) describe and critique the methodological 
      features of waste audits used in hospital foodservice settings that measure 
      aggregate food and food-related waste and (ii) develop a consensus tool for 
      conducting a food waste audit in a hospital foodservice setting. METHODS: Seven 
      electronic databases were searched for peer reviewed literature, and 17 Google 
      Advanced searches located grey literature that described food waste audit methods 
      previously used or developed for hospital foodservices. Study selection and quality 
      assessment occurred in duplicate. Data describing the audit method, its feasibility, 
      and strengths and limitations were extracted and synthesised to develop a consensus 
      tool. RESULTS: Eight peer reviewed and nine grey literature documents describing a 
      variety of food waste audit methods were found. The most common practices were 
      2-week data collection (n = 5), foodservice staff collecting data (n = 6), measuring 
      food waste only (n = 11), measuring food waste at main meals (n = 5) and using 
      electronic scales to measure waste (n = 12). A consensus tool was developed that 
      proposes a method for preparing, conducting and analysing data from a food waste 
      audit. CONCLUSIONS: This review used published evidence to develop the first ever 
      food waste audit consensus tool for hospital foodservices to use and measure food 
      and food-related waste. Future research is needed to apply and test this tool in 
      practice.

TI  - Effectiveness of referral to a population-level telephone coaching service for 
      improving health risk behaviours in people with a mental health condition: study 
      protocol for a randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 49
LID - 10.1186/s13063-021-05971-6 [doi]
LID - 49
AB  - BACKGROUND: People with a mental health condition have a shorter life expectancy 
      than the general population. This is largely attributable to higher rates of chronic 
      disease and a higher prevalence of modifiable health risk behaviours including 
      tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, poor nutrition, and physical inactivity. 
      Telephone support services offer a viable option to provide support to reduce these 
      health risk behaviours at a population-level; however, whilst there is some research 
      pertaining to Quitlines, there is limited other research investigating whether 
      telephone services may offer effective support for people with a mental health 
      condition. This protocol describes a randomised controlled trial that aims to 
      evaluate the referral of people with a mental health condition to a population-level 
      telephone coaching service to increase physical activity, healthy eating, or weight 
      management, and increase attempts to do so. METHODS: A parallel-group randomised 
      controlled trial will be conducted recruiting participants with a mental health 
      condition through community mental health services and advertisement on social 
      media. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either a health information 
      pack only (control) or a health information pack and a proactive referral to a free, 
      government-funded telephone coaching service, the NSW Get Healthy Coaching and 
      Information Service® (intervention), which offers up to 13 telephone coaching calls 
      with a University Qualified Health Coach to assist with client-identified goals 
      relating to physical activity, healthy eating, weight management, or alcohol 
      reduction. Data will be collected via telephone surveys at baseline and 6 months 
      post-recruitment. Primary outcomes are as follows: (1) minutes of moderate to 
      vigorous physical activity per week, (2) serves of fruit consumed per day, (3) 
      serves of vegetables consumed per day, and (4) a composite measure assessing 
      attempts to change at least one health risk behaviour (any attempts to change 
      physical activity, fruit consumption, vegetable consumption, or other parts of 
      nutrition). Secondary outcomes include weight and body mass index. DISCUSSION: This 
      study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of referral to a population-level 
      telephone support service for reducing health risk behaviours relating to physical 
      activity, healthy eating, and weight in people with a mental health condition. 
      Results will inform future policy and practice regarding the delivery of 
      telephone-based behaviour change coaching services and the management of physical 
      health for this population to reduce health inequity and the burden of chronic 
      disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry

AB  - Trichothecenes (TCNs) are the mycotoxins produced by many fungal species such as 
      Fusarium, Myrothecium, and Stachybotrys and pose a considerable health risk. Based 
      on their characteristic functional moieties, they are divided into four categories: 
      Type A (T-2, HT-2, diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS), harzianum A, neosolaniol (NEO) and 
      trichodermin), Type B (deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV), trichothecin and 
      fusarenon X), Type C (crotocin) and Type D (satratoxin G & H, roridin A and 
      verrucarin A) with types A and B being the most substantial. TCNs cause growth 
      retardation in eukaryotes, suppress seedling growth or regeneration in plants and 
      could be a reason for animal reproductive failure. Due to the increased frequency of 
      occurrence and widespread distribution of TCNs in food and feed, knowledge of their 
      sources of occurrence is essential to strategise their control and management. 
      Hence, this review provides an overview of various types and sources of TCNs, the 
      associated biosynthetic pathways and genes responsible for production in food and 
      feed. Further, various processing and environmental effects on TCNs production, 
      detection techniques and management strategies are also briefly outlined.

TI  - Social acceptability of standard and behavioral economic inspired policies designed 
      to reduce and prevent obesity.
PG  - 197-214
LID - 10.1002/hec.4451 [doi]
AB  - The obesity epidemic is a significant public policy issue facing the international 
      community, resulting in substantial costs to individuals and society. Various 
      policies have been suggested to reduce and prevent obesity, including those informed 
      by standard economics (a key feature of which is the assumption that individuals are 
      rational) and behavioral economics (which identifies and harness deviations from 
      rationality). It is not known which policy interventions taxpayers find acceptable 
      and would prefer to fund via taxation. We provide evidence from a discrete choice 
      experiment on an Australian sample of 996 individuals to investigate social 
      acceptability of eight policies: mass media campaign; traffic light nutritional 
      labeling; taxing sugar sweetened beverages; prepaid cards to purchase healthy food; 
      financial incentives to exercise; improved built environment for physical activity; 
      bans on advertising unhealthy food and drink to children; and improved nutritional 
      quality of food sold in public institutions. Latent class analysis revealed three 
      classes differing in preferences and key respondent characteristics including 
      capacity to benefit. Social acceptability of the eight policies at realistic levels 
      of tax increases was explored using post-estimation analysis. Overall, 78% of the 
      sample were predicted to choose a new policy, varying from 99% in those most likely 
      to benefit from obesity interventions to 19% of those least likely to benefit. A 
      policy informed by standard economics, traffic light labeling was the most popular 
      policy, followed by policies involving regulation: bans on junk food advertising to 
      children and improvement of food quality in public institutions. The least popular 
      policies were behaviorally informed: prepaid cards for the purchase of only healthy 
      foods, and financial incentives to exercise.

TI  - Seniors' adoption of digital devices and virtual event platforms in Singapore during 
      Covid-19.
PG  - 101817
LID - 10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101817 [doi]
AB  - In Singapore, with the nationwide implementation of Covid-19 physical restrictions 
      and safe management measures (SMMs) in place because of the pandemic, the seniors' 
      regular routines and daily social activities have been disrupted. Prior research on 
      seniors' adoption of digital technologies has primarily focused on health-related 
      purposes such as nutrition and exercise and managing old-age related diseases. 
      However, there is limited research done to understand how seniors use digital 
      technologies for other purposes, such as social networks or leisure activities, that 
      can help seniors socialise and reduce loneliness despite ongoing SMMs and 
      restrictions on social distancing and physical interactions because of the Covid-19 
      pandemic. In particular, the use of virtual event platforms can make it easier for 
      seniors to communicate and socialise with their peers, thus keeping social isolation 
      and loneliness at bay. In this paper, we discuss seniors' relationship with 
      technology, guided by the social exchange theory. We also share the methodological 
      framework that guided this small-scale study on the use of virtual event platforms, 
      along with the research instruments and measurements required for data collection. 
      The research findings of this study, conducted with 144 respondents aged 60 years 
      old and above, are discussed and further analysed with their theoretical 
      contributions and implications for practice.

TI  - Teachers feeling the burden of COVID-19: Impact on well-being, stress, and burnout.
LID - 10.3233/WOR-210994 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Teachers have had to deal with many of the negative aspects of COVID-19 
      over the past year. The demands associated with the sudden requirement to teach 
      remotely, and later having to manage hybrid (both in person and online) learning may 
      be having adverse effects on the mental and physical health of teachers. OBJECTIVE: 
      To determine whether COVID-19 continued to impact teacher stress, burnout, and 
      wellbeing a year into the pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was sent out to 5300 
      teachers in public and private schools, and 703 completed the survey. RESULTS: 
      Stress and burnout continue to be high for teachers, with 72% of teachers feeling 
      very or extremely stressed, and 57% feel very or extremely burned out. Many teachers 
      struggled to have a satisfactory work-family balance (37% never or almost never; 20% 
      only has sometimes). CONCLUSION: School systems must start to deal with the mental 
      and physical health of teachers before a large number of them leave the profession.

      associated with satisfaction with life and depression among 732 adult same-sex twin 
      pairs (monozygotic and dizygotic) in the US using online survey data. Twin analysis 
      showed that married and/or cohabiting individuals were more satisfied with life and 
      less depressed than those not married and/or cohabiting. The association between 
      marriage and/or cohabiting and satisfaction with life was not confounded by 
      between-family factors, whereas that between depression was mediated by familial 
      factors. These findings suggest that being in a close relationship may mitigate some 
      of the adverse consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Close relationships may be an 
      essential source of support as individuals rely on their intimate partners when 
      faced with the uncertainty and stress of the pandemic.

TI  - Prevalence and Amounts of Common Ingredients Found in Energy Drinks and Shots.
LID - 10.3390/nu14020314 [doi]
LID - 314
AB  - BACKGROUND: Energy drinks are one of the most popular packaged beverage products 
      consumed within the United States (US). Energy drinks are considered a functional 
      beverage, a category that also includes sports drinks and nutraceutical beverages. 
      PURPOSE: The focus of the current study was to examine the nutrition fact panels of 
      the top selling commercially available energy drink and energy shot products within 
      the US to characterize common ingredient profiles to help establish a standard 
      definition and ingredient profile of energy drinks and energy shots for consumers, 
      health care practitioners, and researchers. METHODS: The top 75 commercially 
      available energy drinks and shots were identified and compiled from multiple 
      commercial retail websites as of September 2021. For the purpose of this study, an 
      energy drink must have met the following criteria: (A) marketed as an energy drink; 
      (B) purported to improve energy, focus, or alertness; (C) not sold as a dietary 
      supplement (no supplement fact panels); (D) manufactured as a pre-packaged and 
      ready-to-drink beverage; and (E) contains at least three of (1) caffeine, (2) 
      B-vitamins, (3) sugar, (4) taurine, (5) creatine, (6) quercetin, (7) guarana, (8) 
      ginseng, (9) coenzyme Q10, or (10) branched chain amino acids. Energy shots must 
      have met similar criteria to be included: (A) marketed as an energy shot; (B) 
      purported to improve energy, focus, or alertness; (C) sold as a dietary supplement; 
      (D) manufactured as a pre-packaged beverage with a small volume (<3.5 mL); and (E) 
      contains at least three of the ingredients stated above. RESULTS: Twenty energy 
      shots and fifty-five energy drinks were included in this analysis. The number of 
      ingredients per product (mean ± SD) was 18.2 ± 5.7, with 15 products containing 
      proprietary blends with undisclosed ingredient amounts. The relative prevalence and 
      average amounts of the top ingredients were as follows: caffeine (100%; 174.4 ± 81.1 
      mg), vitamin B6 (72%; 366.9 ± 648.1 percent daily value (%DV)), vitamin B3 (67%; 
      121.44 ± 69.9% DV), vitamin B12 (67%; 5244.5 ± 10,474.6% DV), vitamin B5 (37.3%; 
      113.6 ± 76.6% DV), and taurine (37.3%; amounts undisclosed). CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings suggest a high prevalence of caffeine and B-vitamins in these energy 
      products, with many of the formulations containing well above the recommended daily 
      value of B-vitamins.

TI  - Pro-inflammatory diet and depressive symptoms in the healthcare setting.
PG  - 125
LID - 10.1186/s12888-022-03771-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a highly prevalent disease affecting more than 350 million 
      people and has recently been associated with low-grade chronic inflammation. The 
      role of diet in the development of a pro-inflammatory state was demonstrated in a 
      recent study that found a high Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Index (EDII) score was 
      associated with increased concentrations of circulating plasma inflammatory markers. 
      It is becoming increasingly clear that diet and depression are linked, but the 
      relationship itself has not been determined with absolute certainty. Pharmacologic 
      and device assisted therapies are considered our most advanced treatments for major 
      depressive disorder, though numerous studies suggest that they are not sufficient. 
      Exploring the relationship of a pro-inflammatory diet and depressive symptoms is 
      crucial for a holistic, evidenced-based approach to treating depression. METHODS: 
      Our study investigated this association using the EDII to evaluate the inflammatory 
      potential of diet and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to score depression 
      among healthcare personnel. Results from 631 participants were collected for 
      analysis using REDCap software. RESULTS: High PHQ-9 scores and high EDII scores were 
      significantly correlated (F = 18.32, p < 0.0001) even when accounting for gender, 
      psychiatric diagnosis, physical exercise, and spiritual exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings suggest that anti-inflammatory diets can play a key role in the treatment 
      of depression.

TI  - The triglyceride-glucose index as an adiposity marker and a predictor of fat loss 
      induced by a low-calorie diet.
PG  - e13674
LID - 10.1111/eci.13674 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the putative role of the 
      triglyceride-glucose index (TyG index) computed as ln[TG (mg/dl) × glucose 
      (mg/dl)/2] and derived proxies as predictors of adiposity and weight loss changes 
      after a low-calorie diet (LCD) intervention. METHODS: A total of 744 adult 
      participants from the multicentre DIOGenes intervention study were prescribed a LCD 
      (800 kcal/day) during 8 weeks. Body composition and fat content at baseline and 
      after 8 weeks were estimated by DEXA/BIA. A multivariate analysis approach was used 
      to estimate the difference in ΔWeight(1-2) (kg), ΔBMI(1-2) (kg/m(2) ) or ΔFat(1-2) 
      (%) between the basal value (point 1) and after 8 weeks following a LCD (point 2), 
      respectively. The TyG index at baseline (TyG(1) ), after following the LCD for 
      8 weeks (TyG(2) ) or the TyG index differences between both time points (ΔTyG(1-2) ) 
      were analysed as predictors of weight and fat changes. RESULTS: TyG(1) was 
      associated with ΔWeight(1-2) (kg) and ΔBMI(1-2) (kg/m(2) ), with β = 0.812 
      (p = .017) and β = 0.265 (p = .018), respectively. Also, TyG(2)  values were 
      inversely related to ΔFat(1-2) (%), β = -1.473 (p = .015). Moreover, ΔTyG(1-2) was 
      associated with ΔWeight(1-2) (kg) and ΔFat(1-2) (%), β = 0.689 (p = .045) and 
      β = 1.764 (p = .002), respectively. Furthermore, an association between TyG(2) and 
      resistance to fat loss was found (p = .015). CONCLUSION: TyG(1) index is a good 
      predictor of weight loss induced by LCD. Moreover, TyG(2) was closely related to 
      resistance to fat loss, while ΔTyG(1-2)  values were positively associated with body 
      fat changes. Therefore, TyG index and derived estimations could be used as markers 
      of individualized responses to energy restriction and a surrogate of body 
      composition outcomes in clinical/epidemiological settings in obesity conditions.

TI  - Effects of Exercise in Improving Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Overweight 
      Children: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10010082 [doi]
LID - 82
AB  - This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effects of exercise in improving 
      cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight children and adolescents until the 
      adolescent age, which is 18 years. A systemic search was conducted using the 
      electronic databases PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, from 
      inception to 29 June 2021. All statistical analyses were conducted in Review Manager 
      5.4.1. All studies meeting the inclusion criteria were selected. A random-effect 
      model was used to pool the studies, and the results are reported in the odds ratio 
      (OR) and corresponding 95% Confidence interval (CI). Twelve randomized control 
      trials were selected for meta-analysis. Significant results were obtained for BMI in 
      children after the interventions (0.38 95% CI 0.14, 0.62; p = 0.002; I(2) = 65%). 
      LDL level was also found significantly reduced (0.41 95% CI 0.01, 0.82; p = 0.05; 
      I(2) = 83%). Other factors such as HDL level, blood pressure, blood glucose level, 
      body weight, and waist circumference were also analyzed. We found that exercise 
      interventions significantly improved several cardiometabolic risk factors such as 
      BMI, LDL level, BP, and blood glucose level. However, no significant effect on HDL 
      concentration, waist circumference, and body weight were found. Long-term 
      interventions are needed to attain improvement in all cardiometabolic risk factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD) are a group of rare 
      autosomal-recessive genetic disorders characterized by metabolic deficiencies in 
      which the body is unable to convert long-chain fatty acids into energy. To date, 
      however, there is limited understanding of the patient experience of LC-FAOD. 
      METHODS: The symptoms, observable signs, and quality of life (QoL) impacts 
      associated with LC-FAOD were explored via a focus group (n = 8) and semi-structured 
      interviews (n = 6) with patients and caregivers of patients with LC-FAOD, and 
      interviews (n = 4) with expert clinicians. Data were analyzed via thematic analysis 
      and summarized in a conceptual model. RESULTS: Participants reported a wide range of 
      signs and symptoms associated with LC-FAOD, broadly categorized as musculoskeletal, 
      endocrine/nutritional/metabolic, neurological, gastrointestinal/digestive, sensory, 
      cardiovascular, respiratory, urological, and constitutional. LC-FAOD were reported 
      to have a significant impact on various aspects of patients' lives including 
      physical functioning, participation in daily activities, emotional/psychological 
      wellbeing, and social functioning. Lifestyle modifications (such as diet and 
      exercise restrictions) were necessary because of the condition. Symptoms were 
      typically episodic in presentation often arising or exacerbated during catabolic 
      conditions such as prolonged exercise, fasting, physiological stress, and 
      illness/infection. Symptoms were also commonly reported to lead to emergency room 
      visits, hospitalization, and clinical complications. CONCLUSION: LC-FAOD have a 
      considerable impact on patients' lives. There is a high degree of concordance in the 
      signs, symptoms, and impacts of LC-FAOD reported by patients, caregivers, and 
      clinicians; however, there were many symptoms and impacts that were only reported by 
      patients and caregivers, thus demonstrating that insights from patient/caregiver 
      experience data are integral for informing medical product development and 
      facilitating patient-centered care.

TI  - Reliability and validity of the Stryd Power Meter during different walking 
      conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Styrd Power Meter is gaining special interest for on-field gait 
      analyses due to its low-cost and general availability. However, the reliability and 
      validity of the Stryd during walking on positive slopes using different backpack 
      loads have never been investigated. RESEARCH QUESTION: Is the Stryd Power Meter 
      reliable and valid for quantifying gait mechanics during walking on positive 
      inclines and during level walking incorporating load carriage? METHODS: Seventeen 
      participants from a police force rescue team performed 8 submaximal walking trials 
      for 5-min at 3.6 km·h(-1) during different positive slope (1%, 10% and 20%) and 
      backpack load (0%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% of body mass) conditions. Two Stryd devices 
      were utilized for reliability analyses. Validity of cadence and ground contact time 
      (GCT) were analyzed against a gold standard device (Optojump). RESULTS: The Stryd 
      demonstrated acceptable reliability [mean bias: < 2.5%; effect size (ES): < 0.25; 
      standard error of the mean: < 1.7%; r: > 0.76] for power, cadence, and GCT. Validity 
      measures (mean bias: <0.8%; ES: <0.07; r: >0.96; Lin's Concordance Coefficient: 
      0.96; Mean Absolute Percent Error: <1%) for cadence were also found to be 
      acceptable. The Stryd overestimated (P < 0.001; ES: >5.1) GCT in all the walking 
      conditions. A significant systematic positive bias (P < 0.022; r = 0.56-0.76) was 
      found in 7 conditions. SIGNIFICANCE: The Stryd Power Meter appears to produce 
      reliable measurements for power output, cadence and GCT. The Stryd produced valid 
      measurements for cadence during walking on positive slopes and during level walking 
      with a loaded backpack. However, the Stryd is not valid for measuring GCT during 
      these walking conditions. This study adds novel data regarding the reliability and 
      validity of this device and might be of particular interest for scientists, 
      practitioners, and first responders seeking reliable devices to quantify gait 
      mechanics during walking.

TI  - Fit mothers for a healthy future: Breaking the intergenerational cycle of 
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with maternal exercise.
PG  - e13596
LID - 10.1111/eci.13596 [doi]
AB  - SPECIAL ISSUE: 'FOIEGRAS-Bioenergetic Remodelling in the Pathophysiology and 
      Treatment of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease'. BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty 
      liver disease (NAFLD) emerges as significant health burden worldwide. Lifestyle 
      changes, unhealthy dietary habits and physical inactivity, can trigger NAFLD 
      development. Persisting on these habits during pregnancy affects in utero 
      environment and prompts a specific metabolic response in foetus resulting in 
      offspring metabolic maladjustments potentially critical for developing NAFLD later 
      in life. The increasing prevalence of NAFLD, particularly in children, has shifted 
      the research focus towards preventive and therapeutic strategies. Yet, designing 
      effective approaches that can break the NAFLD intergenerational cycle becomes even 
      more complicated. Regular physical exercise (PE) is a powerful non-pharmacological 
      strategy known to counteract deleterious metabolic outcomes. In this narrative 
      review, we aimed to briefly describe NAFLD pathogenesis focusing on maternal 
      nutritional challenge and foetal programming, and to provide potential mechanisms 
      behind the putative intergenerational effect of PE against metabolic diseases, 
      including liver diseases. METHODS: Following detailed electronic database search, 
      recent existing evidence about NAFLD development, intergenerational programming and 
      gestational exercise effects was critically analysed and discussed. RESULTS: PE 
      during pregnancy could have a great potential to counteract intergenerational 
      transmission of metabolic burden. The interplay between different PE 
      roles-metabolic, endocrine and epigenetic-could offer a more stable in utero 
      environment to the foetus, thus rescuing offspring vulnerability to metabolic 
      disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: The better understanding of maternal PE beneficial 
      consequences on offspring metabolism could reinforce the importance of PE during 
      pregnancy as an indispensable strategy in improving offspring health.

TI  - Does sleep-disordered breathing add to impairments in academic performance and brain 
      structure usually observed in children with overweight/obesity?
LID - 10.1007/s00431-022-04403-0 [doi]
AB  - Approximately 4-11% of children suffer from sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), and 
      children with obesity are at increased risk. Both obesity and SDB have been 
      separately associated with poorer brain health, yet whether SDB severity affects 
      brain health in children with obesity remains unanswered. This study aimed to 
      examine associations of SDB severity with academic performance and brain structure 
      (i.e., total brain and gray and white matter volumes and gray matter volume in the 
      hippocampus) in children with overweight/obesity. One hundred nine children aged 
      8-12 years with overweight/obesity were included. SDB severity and its subscales 
      (i.e., snoring, daytime sleepiness, and inattention/hyperactivity) were evaluated 
      via the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ), and academic performance was evaluated 
      with the Woodcock-Muñoz standardized test and school grades. Brain structure was 
      assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. SDB severity was not associated with 
      academic performance measured by the standardized test (all |β|> 0.160, P > 0.076), 
      yet it was associated with the school grade point average (β = -0.226, P = 0.007) 
      and natural and social science grades (β = -0.269, P = 0.024). 
      Intention/hyperactivity seemed to drive these associations. No associations were 
      found between SDB severity and the remaining school grades (all β < -0.188, 
      P > 0.065) or brain volumes (all P > 0.05).Conclusion: Our study shows that SDB 
      severity was associated with lower school grades, yet it was not associated with the 
      standardized measurement of academic performance or with brain volumes in children 
      with overweight/obesity. SDB severity may add to academic problems in children 
      beyond the effects contributed by overweight/obesity status alone. What is Known: • 
      Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) may affect brain structure and academic performance 
      in children. • Children with overweight/obesity are at higher risk for the 
      development of SDB, yet the comorbid obesity-SDB relationship with brain health has 
      not been investigated thus far. What is New: • To our knowledge, this is the first 
      study examining the associations of comorbid obesity-SDB severity with brain volumes 
      and academic performance in children. • SDB symptoms may adversely affect academic 
      performance at school in children with overweight/obesity, beyond the effects of 
      weight status alone.

TI  - Assessment of activity energy expenditure during competitive golf: The effects of 
      bag carrying, electric or manual trolleys.
PG  - 1-18
LID - 10.1080/17461391.2022.2036817 [doi]
AB  - Golf is a sport played around the globe, with an estimated 42.6 million people 
      playing within the United Kingdom and United States of America alone. To date there 
      is limited data on the energy expenditure of golf. The present study assessed the 
      activity energy expenditure (AEE) of 16 high-standard (handicap under 5) golfers who 
      completed 3 rounds of competitive golf either carrying the golf bag (BC), using a 
      manual push trolley (MT) or an electric trolley (ET) (Stewart Golf, Gloucester, UK). 
      Prior to each round, participants were fitted with an Actiheart® accelerometer 
      (Camntech, Fenstanton, UK) to estimate AEE, whilst ratings of perceived exertion 
      (RPE) and enjoyment were collected following each round. Data were analysed using a 
      one-way repeated measures ANOVA, with Hedges g effect sizes (ES) calculated. Mean 
      (SD) AEE was 688 ± 213 kcal for BC, 756 ± 210 kcal for MT and 663 ± 218 kcal for ET 
      (p=0.05) although these differences were deemed small or less. The ET condition 
      resulted in the lowest mean heart rate, moderate or very large from BC or MT 
      respectively. There were no significant differences in enjoyment although perceived 
      exertion was lowest in the ET condition. In summary, we report meaningful 
      differences in AEE between the 3 conditions (p=0.05), with perceived exertion and 
      maximum HR were lowest when using the electric trolley. Golf may be considered as an 
      effective intervention to increase step count and improve physical activity levels 
      across the general population regardless of transportation methods of clubs. Golf is 
      played around the world both professionally and recreationally although to date 
      research on the activity energy expenditure (AEE) of the sport is limited.We report 
      that the AEE for a round of golf was 3.4, 3.6 and 3.2 kcal.min(-1) for the bag 
      carrying, manual trolley and electric trolley conditions respectively.The mode of 
      transporting the golf clubs had no meaningful differences in AEE although perceived 
      exertion and maximum HR were lowest when using the electric trolley. Golf may be 
      considered as an effective intervention to increase step count and improve physical 
      activity levels across the general population regardless of the transportation 
      methods of clubs.

TI  - Periodised Carbohydrate Intake Does Not Affect Substrate Oxidation but May 
      Contribute to Endurance Capacity.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1080/17461391.2021.2013954 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate whether periodising carbohydrate intake 
      around specific training sessions will enhance endurance training 
      adaptations.Seventeen healthy recreationally endurance-trained males (n = 5) and 
      females (n = 12) (27.5 ± 5.4 years) participated in a four-week training 
      intervention. Participants were divided into two groups: FASTED (stayed fasted 
      between evening high-intensity interval training session and low-intensity training 
      session in the following morning) and FED (no restriction in food intake). Pre- and 
      post-testing included peak oxygen uptake (VO(2peak)), anaerobic capacity, and 60 min 
      submaximal running tests. Fasted venous blood samples were drawn for the 
      determination of triglyceride and glucose concentrations.VO(2peak) increased in both 
      FASTED (4.4 ± 3.0%, p = 0.001) and FED (4.6 ± 4.2%, p = 0.017), whereas maximal 
      running velocity increased only in the FASTED (3.5 ± 2.7%, p = 0.002). Lactate 
      concentrations in the anaerobic test after intervention were greater in FASTED than 
      FED (p = 0.025-0.041). Running time in the anaerobic test was improved in FASTED 
      (from 64.1 ± 15.6-86.3 ± 23.2 s, p < 0.001) but not in FED (from 
      56.4 ± 15.2-66.9 ± 21.3 s, p = 0.099). Substrate oxidation did not change after 
      intervention in either of the groups (p = 0.052-0.597). Heart rate was lower in the 
      submaximal running test in FASTED (p < 0.001) but not in FED (p = 0.097).Training 
      with periodised carbohydrate availability does not have any effect on substrate 
      oxidation. However, it seems to enhance the capacity to perform high-intensity 
      exercise.

LID - 10.1123/ijsnem.2021-0262 [doi]
AB  - There is some controversy regarding the interactions between creatine (CRE) and 
      caffeine (CAF) supplements. The aim of this systematic review was to study whether 
      such ergogenic interaction occurs and to analyze the protocol to optimize their 
      synchronous use. The PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus 
      databases were searched until November 2021 following the PRISMA guidelines. Ten 
      studies were included. Three studies observed that CRE loading before an acute dose 
      of CAF before exercise did not interfere in the beneficial effect of CAF, whereas 
      one study reported that only an acute supplementation (SUP) of CAF was beneficial 
      but not the acute SUP of both. When chronic SUP with CRE + CAF was used, two studies 
      reported that CAF interfered in the beneficial effect of CRE, whereas three studies 
      did not report interaction between concurrent SUP, and one study reported synergy. 
      Possible mechanisms of interaction are opposite effects on relaxation time and 
      gastrointestinal distress derived from concurrent SUP. CRE loading does not seem to 
      interfere in the acute effect of CAF. However, chronic SUP of CAF during CRE loading 
      could interfere in the beneficial effect of CRE.

TI  - Development and application of specific questions to classify a child as food 
      texture sensitive.
PG  - 3-17
LID - 10.1111/jtxs.12627 [doi]
AB  - Understanding food texture sensitivity in children is important in guiding food 
      selection. The objective of this work was to develop a short questionnaire that 
      could be completed by parents in nonclinical settings to provide a categorization 
      for food texture sensitivity in children. This study evaluated the distribution of 
      children as texture sensitive (TS) or non-texture sensitive (NTS) and the predictive 
      validity of these questions to explain rejection of specific food textures. Three 
      sets of survey data were examined, including data from a home-use test (HUT) in 
      children with and without Down syndrome (DS), and lingual tactile sensitivity 
      measured by grating orientation task (GOT). From three parent-completed surveys, the 
      use of the questionnaire yielded a similar distribution of children in the TS 
      category (16-22%) as previously reported. TS children (4-36 months) were more likely 
      to reject specific food textures, including chewy, hard, lumpy, and "tough meat" 
      (p < .05). A higher percentage of children with a diagnosis of DS were TS (36.9%). 
      Children who were TS showed increased negative behaviors to foods and ate less than 
      NTS children. In older children (5-12 years), TS children were fussier than NTS 
      children (p < .001). Lingual tactile sensitivity was not significantly different by 
      TS/NTS categorization (p = .458). This study demonstrated that the use of these five 
      questions specific to food texture provides a useful tool in categorizing a child as 
      TS/NTS, with this information being useful in selecting preferred food textures. 
      Future studies involving these TS questions should perform psychometric assessments 
      and measures of criterion validity using other questionnaires.

TI  - Health promotion in emerging collectivist communities: A study of dietary 
      acculturation in the South Sudanese community in Logan City, Australia.
PG  - 224-231
LID - 10.1002/hpja.491 [doi]
AB  - ISSUE ADDRESSED: Understanding dietary acculturation within collectivist communities 
      is required to develop and tailor appropriate health promotion strategies to prevent 
      diet-related chronic diseases. This research explores the journey of the South 
      Sudanese community living in Logan City, Australia in establishing new norms around 
      food choices and practices over time. METHODS: Three semi-structured group 
      interviews and a final community forum of women (n = 20) from the South Sudanese 
      community were conducted. These explored changes in and influences on dietary 
      practices post-settlement. Sessions were recorded, transcribed and thematically 
      analysed using inductive and deductive approaches. Feedback on findings from 
      participants and community members was incorporated. RESULTS: Participants reported 
      dietary acculturation phases, including assimilation, reflection and separation, 
      with a return to traditional foods over time. Factors influencing the transition 
      between phases included; the characteristics of the collectivist community such as 
      shared knowledge, experiences and resources, increased accessibility to traditional 
      foods, and increased food and health literacy as responses to emerging diet-related 
      health issues. CONCLUSIONS: The Logan City South Sudanese community has navigated a 
      new and complex food environment with positive long-term dietary outcomes; however, 
      the initial decline in health due to poor diet on arrival may have been prevented. 
      SO WHAT?: Early intervention and culturally appropriate health promotion strategies 
      that are co-designed and tailored to the characteristics and strengths of newly 
      settled collectivist communities are needed. These should promote the benefits of 
      healthy traditional food habits, while assisting communities to successfully 
      navigate a new food environment.

TI  - Perspective: Vegan Diets for Older Adults? A Perspective On the Potential Impact On 
      Muscle Mass and Strength.
LID - nmac009 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/advances/nmac009 [doi]
AB  - Consumers are increasingly encouraged to consume more plant-based foods and lower 
      their consumption of foods from animal origin. Concurrently, older adults are 
      recommended to consume an adequate amount of high-quality dietary protein for the 
      prevention of age-related muscle loss. In the current perspective, we discuss why it 
      may not be preferred to consume a vegan diet at an older age. Our perspective is 
      based on the proposed lower bioavailability and functionality of proteins in a vegan 
      diet due to the matrix of the whole-food protein sources, the lower essential amino 
      acid (EAA) content, and specific EAA deficiencies in proteins derived from 
      plant-based foods. We propose that a vegan diet increases the risk of an inadequate 
      protein intake at an older age and that current strategies to improve the anabolic 
      properties of plant-based foods are not feasible for many older adults. We provide 
      recommendations for further research to substantiate the remaining knowledge gaps 
      regarding the consequences of a vegan diet on skeletal muscle mass and strength at 
      an older age.

AB  - Obesity is caused by a combination of hereditary and environmental factors. Despite 
      extensive study, contemporary through diet, exercise, education, surgery, and 
      pharmacological treatments, no effective long-term solution has been found to this 
      epidemic. Over the last decade, there has been a tremendous advancement in 
      understanding the science of epigenetics, as well as a rise in public interest in 
      learning more about the influence of diet and lifestyle choices on the health of an 
      individual. Without affecting the underlying DNA sequence, epigenetic alterations 
      impact gene expression. Previous animal studies have shown a link between the type 
      of diet and expression or suppression of obesity genes, but there are very few human 
      studies that demonstrate the relationship between dietary intake and obesity gene 
      expression. This review highlights the effects of carbohydrates, lipids, and protein 
      intake from the diet on obesity-related genes.

AB  - Elevated body mass index (BMI) has been associated with elevated urine osmolality 
      (UOsm), despite having higher total water intake, but it is unclear if 
      overweight/obese individuals have reduced thirst. In this observational study, we 
      found that overweight/obese individuals had higher UOsm compared to normal-weight 
      individuals (749 ± 37 vs. 624 ± 35 mmol•kg(-1); P < 0.01) while possessing similar 
      thirst ratings (56.4 ± 3 vs. 51.6 ± 3 mm; P = 0.3). In this observational study, 
      overweight/obese individuals possessed more concentrated urine in the absence of 
      higher thirst perception.

AB  - Older African Americans with multimorbidity are at an especially high risk of 
      adverse outcomes due to synergistic risks conferred by age, chronic disease burden 
      and social determinants of health. Chronic condition self-management is one way 
      older African Americans can use health management occupations and exercise agency to 
      reduce their risk of becoming severely ill, and during the ongoing pandemic, of 
      COVID-19 infection. The objective of this study was to understand how the COVID-19 
      pandemic shaped health management occupations of older African Americans. In-depth 
      qualitative interviews were conducted with 30 African Americans aged 65 and older 
      who reported having two or more chronic conditions. Data were analyzed using 
      thematic analysis. Data suggest how key health management occupations (accessing 
      care; managing medications, nutrition, and physical activity; and social and 
      emotional health promotion and maintenance) were utilized and also shaped by the 
      pandemic. Another key finding was perceived benefits of the pandemic on health and 
      well-being.

AB  - The present study investigated the relationship between birth size and activity

      weight was adjusted for gestational age (AdjBW). The overall association between 
      time spent in MVPA/day and AdjBW was not significant (B = 5.64, p = .09). MVPA/day 
      increased by 7.02 min (p = .02) in participants 18-21 years (N = 42) and decreased 
      by 10.8 min (p = .02) in participants 22-40 years (N = 33) per unit increase in 
      AdjBW. The effect of birth size on adult physical activity depends on age.

      obesity: A multicountry study of children and adolescents.
PG  - e13387
LID - 10.1111/obr.13387 [doi]
AB  - This study assessed associations between ultraprocessed food consumption and dietary 
      nutrient profile linked to obesity in children and adolescents in Argentina, 
      Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United 
      States using nationally representative data collected between 2004 and 2014. Linear 
      regression models were used to evaluate associations between dietary share of 
      ultraprocessed foods (country and age group-specific quintiles and a 10% share 
      increase) and the energy density of diets and their content of free sugars and 
      fiber. Ultraprocessed foods, defined by the NOVA system, ranged from 18% of total 
      energy intake among preschool children in Colombia to 68% among adolescents in the 
      United Kingdom. In almost all countries and age groups, increases in the dietary 
      share of ultraprocessed foods were associated with increases in energy density and 
      free sugars and decreases in fiber, suggesting that ultraprocessed food consumption 
      is a potential determinant of obesity in children and adolescents. Effective global 
      policy action to address growing ultraprocessed food consumption and childhood 
      obesity is urgently needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Substance use disorder (SUD) causes conditions such as cognitive and 
      behavioral disorders, anxiety, depression, and social isolation it also causes acute 
      airway inflammation by affecting airway bronchial dynamics. The current study aimed 
      to investigate the lung function, respiratory muscle strength, and exercise capacity 
      in patients with SUD. METHODS: One hundred-eighty three patients with SUD, a total 
      of 119 healthy controls, 54 of whom were cigarette smokers and 65 of whom were 
      non-smokers were included in the study. Spirometric tests, respiratory muscle 
      strength (MIP and MEP), and the 6-Minute Walk Test (6-MWT) were assessed. The III 
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to evaluate respiratory 
      symptoms in patients with SUD and cigarette smokers. RESULTS: 86.3% of the SUD 
      patients included in the study were using heroin, 9.2% were cannabis, and 5.5% were 
      spice. The most common symptom in both SUD patients and cigarette smokers was 
      shortness of breath, wheezing, and sputum production. After post-hoc tests, the FVC 
      (p = 0.002), FVC (%predicted) (p < 0.0001), FEV(1) (p = 0.002), FEV1 (%predicted) 
      (p < 0.0001), FEV(1)/FVC (%) (p < 0.0001), PEF (p < 0.0001) and FEF(%25-75) 
      (p < 0.0001) lung function parameters were significantly lower in SUD patients than 
      non-smokers. In addition, it was found that MIP (p < 0.0001), MIP (%predicted) 
      (p < 0.0001), MEP (p < 0.0001), and MEP (%predicted) (p < 0.0001) values of SUD 
      patients were significantly lower than non-smokers. CONCLUSION: The study findings 
      indicate that substance use has an effect on lung functions and the most commonly 
      reported symptoms are shortness of breath, wheezing, and sputum production. In 
      addition, respiratory muscle strength and exercise capacity were decreased in SUD 
      patients compared to non-smokers.

TI  - Dose-response relationship in non-pharmacological interventions for individuals with 
      mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised 
      controlled trials.
LID - 10.1111/jocn.16240 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) are important in cognitive 
      decline prevention in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the 
      dose-response relationship remains unclear. DESIGN: Systematic review and 
      meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. METHODS: Seven databases were 
      searched until April 2020. RCTs of NPIs in individuals with MCI were eligible for 
      inclusion. Hedge's g was used to calculate the effect size. A random-effect 
      meta-analysis was used to explore the impact of NPIs on cognition. Subgroup analysis 
      was used to investigate the moderates. The dose was measured by prescription 
      (frequency, intensity, type, time and volume) and intervention characteristics 
      (period, energy expenditure, delivery mode and setting) in NPIs. RESULTS: 
      Forty-two studies with 4401 participants were included. In the NPIs, cognitive 
      intervention (g = 0.167), physical exercise (g = 0.536) and multicomponent 
      intervention (g = 0.386) had significant effect on cognition in individuals with 
      MCI. Dose-response results showed cognition could be significantly improved in 1-2 
      times/week (p < .05), 60-120 min/session (p < .05), ≥12 weeks (p < .05), supervised 
      (p < .05), clinical setting (p < .05) in cognitive intervention. In physical 
      exercise, cognition could be improved in ≥3 times/week (p < .05), vigorous-intensity 
      (p < .05), muscle-strengthening activity (p < .05), 30-60 min/session (p < .05), 
      6-12 weeks (p < .05), unsupervised (p < .05), community setting (p < .05). In the 
      multicomponent intervention, cognition could be improved in 1-2 times/week 
      (p < .05), 30-60 min/session (p < .05), 8-16 weeks (p < .05), clinical (p < .05). In 
      nutrition intervention, cognition could be better improved DHA (p < .05), 
      >1000 mg/day (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of cognitive intervention is 
      significantly influenced by frequency, time, period, delivery mode and setting. The 
      effectiveness of physical exercise is significantly influenced by frequency, 
      intensity, type, time, period, delivery mode and setting. The effectiveness of 
      multicomponent intervention is significantly influenced by frequency, time, period 
      and setting. The effectiveness of nutrition intervention is significantly influenced 
      by dose and type. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The research summarised the 
      evidence to guide the best prescription of NPIs and helped clinicians design more 
      effective interventions in individuals with MCI.

TI  - Posture economy: the importance of metabolic state on metabolic phenotype assessment 
      and the energy cost of sitting and standing. A whole body calorimetry trial.
LID - 10.1038/s41430-022-01077-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metabolic state (fed vs fasted) can result in marked differences in 
      exercise metabolism, fat, and carbohydrate oxidation. In addition, a large 
      inter-individual range in metabolic response to sitting and standing when fasted has 
      been observed. Here, we examined the effect of metabolic state on the energy cost of 
      posture allocation. METHODS: Thirty male participants were recruited and followed a 
      1 h sit-stand protocol in a fasted and fed state inside a whole body calorimeter to 
      measure energy expenditure (EE) and respiratory quotient (RQ). Body composition and 
      resting metabolic rate were measured before the start. Fasted EE response was used 
      to phenotype participants as energy savers (≤5% ΔEE from sitting to standing) or 
      energy spenders (>5% ΔEE). RESULTS: In a fasted state, ΔEE from sitting to standing 
      in energy spenders was 10.2 ± 2.7% compared to 2.6 ± 1.9% in energy savers 
      (p < 0.001). Postprandial, there was no difference in ΔEE between energy spenders 
      and energy savers (10.8 ± 5.1% vs 9.4 ± 5.7%). In a fasted state, significant 
      correlations were observed between body fat (%) and ΔEE (%) (R(2) = 0.55, 
      p < 0.001), body fat (%) and ΔRQ (R(2) = 0.28, p < 0.001) and ΔEE (%) and ΔRQ 
      (R(2) = 0.43, p < 0.001); these correlations were not present after the meal. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed for the first time, that the observed 
      difference between energy spenders and energy savers in a fasted state, disappeared 
      after the consumption of a meal. Therefore, metabolic state may be important to 
      consider when assessing metabolic phenotypes. Differences in body composition were 
      observed between the energy spender and energy saver phenotype. The current findings 
      may have implications on health and weight management recommendations on posture to 
      increase non-exercise activity thermogenesis. This trial was retrospectively 
      registered on 19 December 2017 as NCT03378115 on Clinicaltrials.gov .

TI  - The dietary inflammatory index, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular risk 
      factors and diseases.
PG  - e13349
LID - 10.1111/obr.13349 [doi]
AB  - An unhealthy diet is a recognized risk factor in the pathophysiology of numerous 
      chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCD), including obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), 
      and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This is, at least in part, due to unhealthy diets 
      causing chronic low-grade inflammation in the gut and systemically. To characterize 
      the inflammatory potential of diet, we developed the Dietary Inflammatory Index 
      (DII®). Following this development, around 500 papers have been published, which 
      examined the association between the DII, energy-adjusted DII (E-DII™), and the 
      children's DII (C-DII™) and many chronic NCDs including obesity and cardiometabolic 
      diseases. Although a previous narrative review published in 2019 briefly summarized 
      the evidence in this area, there was a significant increase in papers on this topic 
      since 2020. Therefore, the purpose of this narrative review is to provide an 
      in-depth updated review by including all papers until July 2021 on DII and its 
      relationship with obesity, T2DM, and CVD. Furthermore, we aim to identify potential 
      gaps in the literature and provide future directions for research. Most studies 
      found that DII was associated with an increased risk of obesity, T2DM, and CVD with 
      some relationships being sex-specific. However, we identified the paucity of papers 
      describing associations between dietary inflammation and T2DM and its risk factors. 
      Few studies used gold-standard measures of cardiometabolic risk factors. We also 
      identified the lack of interventional studies designed to change the inflammatory 
      potential of diets and study its effect on cardiometabolic risk factors and 
      diseases. We recommend that such interventional studies are needed to assess if 
      changes in DII, representing the inflammatory potential of diet, independently of 
      changes in body composition can modulate cardiometabolic risk factors and diseases.

AB  - Functional ability and intrinsic capacity are key elements of healthy aging, in 
      which exercise and good nutrition play important roles. This 12-week double-blinded 
      randomized controlled trial enrolled community-dwelling adults aged 50 years and 
      older to examine the effects of Sarcojoint®, a comprehensive formula for the 
      musculoskeletal system, plus resistance exercise on muscle mass. This study intended 
      to enroll 80 participants with a randomly selected subsample of 32 participants (16 
      from the intervention group and 16 from controls) for magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) to assess the cross-sectional area of the bilateral mid-thighs. The 
      participants were then randomly assigned to the intervention group (Sarcojoint® 1 
      package twice a day) and control group (vitamin B as placebo) at a 1: 1 ratio. All 
      the participants were required to undergo a regular exercise program (45 min at the 
      gym per week and two sessions of 30-min exercise at home). The data from 66 
      participants (68.1 ± 7.1 years and 16.7% males; intervention group: 32, control 
      group: 34) were available for analysis. The whole study was pre-registered and data 
      reporting followed Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials with the primary 
      endpoints of muscle mass, 30-s chair-rise test, and gait speed. Results of MRI were 
      the subgroup analysis to examine muscle mass and intramuscular adiposity. The 
      baseline characteristics of all the participants between groups were similar, as 
      well as those of the MRI subgroups. Within-group comparisons showed that the 
      intervention group, but not the control group, significantly reduced the total body 
      fat percentage (34.3 ± 5.5 vs. 35.0 ± 5.4%, P = 0.021). Serum vitamin D was 
      increased in the intervention group (24.1 ± 6.1 vs. 21.1 ± 7.0 ng/mL; P = 0.025) and 
      was reduced in the control group (18.0 ± 5.2 vs. 20.2 ± 5.8 ng/mL; P = 0.006). The 
      physical performance tests of both groups were significantly improved. The 
      between-group analysis showed no significant differences in 30-s chair stand test, 
      handgrip strength and appendicular muscle mass. The sub-group analysis showed 
      significant improvement in the serum levels of vitamin D (6.70 ± 8.20 vs. 
      -0.50 ± 3.90 ng/mL; P = 0.001) and the mid-thigh cross-sectional area of the 
      nondominant legs (165.4 ± 291.4 vs. -61.1 ± 195.0 mm(2); P = 0.034) in the 
      intervention group. In conclusion, Sarcojoint® plus resistance exercise 
      significantly increased muscle mass and serum levels of vitamin D, but not 
      significantly better in muscle strength and physical performance than controls. More 
      investigations are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of Sarcojoint® on 
      middle-aged and older adults.

AB  - Klawitter, L, Vincent, BM, Choi, BJ, Smith, J, Hammer, KD, Jurivich, DA, Dahl, LJ, 
      and McGrath, R. Handgrip strength asymmetry and weakness are associated with future 
      morbidity accumulation in americans. J Strength Cond Res 36(1): 106-112, 
      2022-Identifying strength asymmetries in physically deconditioned populations may 
      help in screening and treating persons at risk for morbidities linked to muscle 
      dysfunction. Our investigation sought to examine the associations between handgrip 
      strength (HGS) asymmetry and weakness on accumulating morbidities in aging 
      Americans. The analytic sample included 18,506 Americans aged ≥50 years from the 
      2006-2016 Health and Retirement Study. Handgrip strength was measured on each hand 
      with a handgrip dynamometer, and persons with an imbalance in strength >10% between 
      hands had HGS asymmetry. Men with HGS <26 kg and women with HGS <16 kg were 
      considered as weak. Subjects reported the presence of healthcare provider-diagnosed 
      morbidities: hypertension, diabetes, cancer, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular 
      disease, stroke, arthritis, and psychiatric problems. Covariate-adjusted ordinal 
      generalized estimating equations analyzed the associations for each HGS asymmetry 
      and weakness group on future accumulating morbidities. Of those included in our 
      study, subjects at baseline were aged 65.0 ± 10.2 years, 9,570 (51.7%) had 
      asymmetric HGS, and 996 (5.4%) were weak. Asymmetry alone and weakness alone were 
      associated with 1.09 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.14) and 1.27 (CI: 
      1.11-1.45) greater odds for future accumulating morbidities, respectively. Having 
      both HGS asymmetry and weakness was associated with 1.46 (CI: 1.29-1.65) greater 
      odds for future accumulating morbidities. Handgrip-strength asymmetry, as another 
      potential indicator of impaired muscle function, is associated with future morbidity 
      status during aging. Exercise professionals and related practitioners should 
      consider examining asymmetry and weakness with handgrip dynamometers as a simple and 
      noninvasive screening method for helping to determine muscle dysfunction and future 
      chronic disease risk.

TI  - Ingestion of Carbohydrate Solutions and Mouth Rinse on Mood and Perceptual Responses 
      during Exercise in Triathletes.
LID - 10.3390/gels8010050 [doi]
LID - 50
AB  - Triathlons are endurance events that include swimming, running, and cycling. 
      Triathletes need to eat optimally during training and competitions to maximize their 
      potential for success. The presence of carbohydrates in the mouth could activate 
      regions in the brain to enhance athletic performance in exercise. METHODS: This 
      study examined the effects of glucose and mouthwash in ten male triathletes (age: 
      26.0 ± 8.7 years, height: 173.6 ± 10.4 cm, BMI 22.0 ± 1.7 kg/m(2)). The four oral 
      test solutions included (A) Rinse with placebo, (B) Water + gel with placebo, (C) 
      Rinse with 15% CH concentration, and (D) Water + gel with 15% CH concentration (25 g 
      gel in 165 mL water). The Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE), Sensation Scale (FS), 
      Felt Arousal Scale (FAS), Profile of Mood States (POMS), blood glucose, sprints, and 
      dietary habits were assessed in each subject. All preceded ingestion of the 
      oral-based test solution during workouts. RESULTS: RPE showed no significant 
      differences for subjective perceptions. The same was observed for FS and sprints. 
      FAS scores increased over time (p = 0.039) in all groups. POMS score increased 
      significantly in group D (p = 0.041). There was no effect of time on plasma glucose 
      levels (p = 0.737). As for correlations, positive correlations were observed between 
      sprint and FAS variables (p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: It appears that CH intake 
      correlates positively with mood, but in all other variables, there are no 
      differences depending on the product.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) have known balance 
      impairments thought to be the result of an inability to reweight sensory 
      information. CAI patients place greater emphasis on visual information during 
      single-limb stance than healthy controls but this evidence is based on removing 
      visual information during static conditions. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does perturbed 
      optical flow effect step kinematics and variability in those with CAI differently 
      than healthy controls? What is the relationship among ankle laxity, plantar 
      cutaneous sensation, and susceptibility to perturbed optical flow in those with CAI? 
      METHODS: 17 CAI patients and 17 healthy individuals participated in a crossover 
      experimental study. Participants walked on a treadmill at 1.25 m/s while watching a 
      speed-matched virtual hallway with and without continuous mediolateral (ML) optical 
      flow perturbations. Three-dimensional pelvic and foot kinematics were recorded at 
      100 Hz for at least 300 consecutive steps in each condition. Step width (SW) and 
      step length (SL) values were calculated from consecutive heel positions. Gait 
      variability was characterized as the standard deviation of step width (SWV), step 
      length (SLV), and ML sacrum motion (SMV) across all steps performed in each 
      condition. RESULTS: The CAI group exhibited a greater change in SWV (p = 0.037), SLV 
      (p = 0.040), and ML SMV (p = 0.047) from the perturbed to unperturbed conditions 
      relative to the healthy controls. A condition main effect was also noted for SW 
      (p < 0.001) and SL (p < 0.001) as ML optical flow perturbations resulted in 
      significant changes in SW and SL relative to the normal walking condition. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Walking with ML optical flow perturbations induced greater variability 
      changes in those with CAI relative to controls. When combined with the existing 
      literature, this finding suggests that CAI individuals have a greater reliance on 
      visual information in both static and dynamic (i.e. walking gait) conditions 
      relative to healthy individuals.

PG  - 530-535
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000002808 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Water immersion adds additional drag and metabolic demand for limb movement 
      with respect to air, but its effect on the internal metabolic power (Ėint) of 
      cycling is unknown. We aimed at quantifying the increase in Ėint during underwater 
      cycling with respect to dry conditions at different pedaling rates. METHODS: Twelve 
      healthy subjects (four women) pedaled on a waterproof cycle ergometer in an 
      experimental pool that was either empty (DRY) or filled with tap water at 30.8°C ± 
      0.6°C (WET). Four different pedal cadences (fp) were studied (40, 50, 60, and 70 
      rpm) at 25, 50, 75, and 100 W. The metabolic power at steady state was measured via 
      open circuit respirometry, and Ėint was calculated as the metabolic power 
      extrapolated for 0 W. RESULTS: The Ėint was significantly higher in WET than in DRY 
      at 50, 60, and 70 rpm (81 ± 31 vs 32 ± 30 W, 167 ± 35 vs 50 ± 29 W, 311 ± 51 vs 81 ± 
      30 W, respectively, all P < 0.0001), but not at 40 rpm (16 ± 5 vs 11 ± 17 W, P > 
      0.99). Ėint increased with the third power of fp both in WET and DRY (R2 = 0.49 and 
      0.91, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Water drag increased Ėint, although limbs 
      unloading via the Archimedes' principle and limbs shape could be potential 
      confounding factors. A simple formula was developed to predict the increase in 
      mechanical power in dry conditions needed to match the rate of energy expenditure 
      during underwater cycling: 44 fp3 - 7 W, where fp is expressed in Hertz.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether Hispanic residents receiving the Healthy Fit 
      intervention enhanced with Motivational Interviewing (MI) experienced greater 
      improvements in body composition, relative to participants receiving the initial 
      intervention. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental evaluation. SETTING: El Paso, Texas. 
      SAMPLE: Among 656 baseline participants, 374 (54%) completed the 12-month 
      assessment. INTERVENTION: In Healthy Fit, community health workers (CHWs) promote 
      nutrition and exercise. To strengthen intrinsic motivation and help participants 
      overcome barriers to change, we incorporated a 30-minute motivational interview into 
      the baseline assessment. Follow-up phone calls at 1, 3, and 6 months were identical 
      across conditions. MEASURES: CHWs assessed body mass index (BMI) and body fat 
      percentage (BFP) using a bioelectrical impedance scale. ANALYSIS: Regression models 
      estimated differences between intervention conditions on change in BMI and BFP from 
      baseline to the 12-month assessment. RESULTS: Participants receiving MI had 2.13 
      times higher odds of losing weight (OR = 2.14, 95% CI [1.30, 3.53], P = .003) and 
      2.59 times higher odds of reduced BFP (OR = 2.59, 95% CI [1.51, 4.41], P < .001), 
      relative to initial intervention participants. MI participants lost an average of 
      1.23 kg (2.71 lbs.) and their BFP declined 2% over 12 months. CONCLUSION: Findings 
      suggest CHW use of MI is a promising approach for promoting incremental changes in 
      diet and exercise, which Healthy Fit integrates into a low-cost intervention.

LID - 10.1042/BCJ20210073 [doi]
AB  - Insulin rapidly stimulates GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport in fat and 
      muscle cells. Signals from the occupied insulin receptor are translated into 
      downstream signalling changes in serine/threonine kinases within timescales of 
      seconds, and this is followed by delivery and accumulation of the glucose 
      transporter GLUT4 at the plasma membrane. Kinetic studies have led to realisation 
      that there are distinct phases of this stimulation by insulin. There is a rapid 
      initial burst of GLUT4 delivered to the cell surface from a subcellular reservoir 
      compartment and this is followed by a steady-state level of continuing stimulation 
      in which GLUT4 recycles through a large itinerary of subcellular locations. Here, we 
      provide an overview of the phases of insulin stimulation of GLUT4 translocation and 
      the molecules that are currently considered to activate these trafficking steps. 
      Furthermore, we suggest how use of new experimental approaches together with 
      phospho-proteomic data may help to further identify mechanisms for activation of 
      these trafficking processes.

TI  - Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio is not related to carotid atherosclerosis progression 
      and cardiovascular events in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: 
      Results from the IMPROVE study.
PG  - 100-110
LID - 10.1002/biof.1801 [doi]
AB  - Inflammation is a component of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and is associated 
      with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The 
      neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a possible inflammation metric for the 
      detection of ASCVD risk, although results of prospective studies are highly 
      inconsistent on this topic. We investigated the cross-sectional relationship between 
      NLR and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in subjects at moderate-to-high ASCVD 
      risk. The prospective association between NLR, cIMT progression, and incident 
      vascular events (VEs) was also explored. In 3341 subjects from the IMT-Progression 
      as Predictors of VEs (IMPROVE) study, we analyzed the association between NLR, cIMT, 
      and its 15-month progression. The association between NLR and incident VEs was also 
      investigated. NLR was positively associated with cross-sectional measures of cIMT, 
      but not with cIMT progression. The association between NLR and cross-sectional cIMT 
      measures was abolished when adjusted for confounders. No association was found 
      between NRL and incident VEs. Similarly, there were no significant differences in 
      the hazard ratios (HRs) of VEs across NLR quartiles. NLR was neither associated with 
      the presence and progression of carotid atherosclerosis, nor with the risk of VEs. 
      Our findings do not support the role of NLR as a predictor of the risk of 
      atherosclerosis progression and ASCVD events in subjects at moderate-to-high ASCVD 
      risk, in primary prevention. However, the usefulness of NLR for patients at a 
      different level of ASCVD risk cannot be inferred from this study.

TI  - Effects of Periodization on Strength and Muscle Hypertrophy in Volume-Equated 
      Resistance Training Programs: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s40279-021-01636-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In resistance training, periodization is often used in an attempt to 
      promote development of strength and muscle hypertrophy. However, it remains unclear 
      how resistance training variables are most effectively periodized to maximize gains 
      in strength and muscle hypertrophy. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to 
      examine the current body of literature to determine whether there is an effect of 
      periodization of training volume and intensity on maximal strength and muscle 
      hypertrophy, and, if so, to determine how these variables are more effectively 
      periodized to promote increases in strength and muscle hypertrophy, when volume is 
      equated between conditions from pre to post intervention. METHODS: Systematic 
      searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus and SPORTDiscus databases. Data from the 
      individual studies were extracted and coded. Meta-analyses using the 
      inverse-variance random effects model were performed to compare 1-repetition maximum 
      (1RM) and muscle hypertrophy outcomes in (a) non-periodized (NP) versus periodized 
      training and (b) in linear periodization (LP) versus undulating periodization (UP). 
      Subgroup analyses examining whether results were affected by training status were 
      performed. Meta-analyses of other periodization model comparisons were not 
      performed, due to a low number of studies. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies met the 
      inclusion criteria. Results of the meta-analyses comparing NP and periodized 
      training demonstrated an overall effect on 1RM strength favoring periodized training 
      (ES 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.04, 0.57]; Z = 2.28, P = 0.02). In 
      contrast, muscle hypertrophy did not differ between NP and periodized training (ES 
      0.13, 95% CI [-0.10, 0.36]; Z = 1.10, P = 0.27). Results of the meta-analyses 
      comparing LP and UP indicated an overall effect on 1RM favoring UP (ES 0.31, 95% CI 
      [0.02, 0.61]; Z = 2.06, P = 0.04). Subgroup analyses indicated an effect on 1RM 
      favoring UP in trained participants (ES 0.61, 95% CI [0.00, 1.22]; Z = 1.97 
      (P = 0.05)), whereas changes in 1RM did not differ between LP and UP in untrained 
      participants (ES 0.06, 95% CI [-0.20, 0.31]; Z = 0.43 (P = 0.67)). The meta-analyses 
      showed that muscle hypertrophy did not differ between LP and UP (ES 0.05, 95% CI 
      [-0.20, 0.29]; Z = 0.36 (P = 0.72)). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that when 
      volume is equated between conditions, periodized resistance training has a greater 
      effect on 1RM strength compared to NP resistance training. Also, UP resulted in 
      greater increases in 1RM compared to LP. However, subgroup analyses revealed that 
      this was only the case for trained and not previously untrained individuals, 
      indicating that trained individuals benefit from daily or weekly undulations in 
      volume and intensity, when the aim is maximal strength. Periodization of volume and 
      intensity does not seem to affect muscle hypertrophy in volume-equated pre-post 
      designs. Based on this, we propose that the effects of periodization on maximal 
      strength may instead be related to the neurophysiological adaptations accompanying 
      resistance training.

      adults with overweight and obesity in a volume-dependent manner: A 1-year 
      dose-response randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1080/17461391.2021.2025434 [doi]
AB  - This study examined the dose-response effects of a 1-year hybrid-type, 
      multicomponent interval training programme (DoIT) on various musculoskeletal fitness 
      parameters in inactive overweight and obese adults in a gym setting. Ninety-seven 
      middle-aged (44.8 ± 5.2 years) individuals with overweight/obesity (31.2 ± 5.7 
      kg/m(2)) (66% female) were randomly assigned to the following groups: (i) 
      no-intervention control (CON, n = 29), (ii) DoIT performed once weekly (DoIT-1, 
      n = 24), (iii) DoIT performed twice weekly (DoIT-2, n = 23) and (iv) DoIT performed 
      thrice weekly (DoIT-3, n = 21). DoIT was a time-efficient, intermittent-based, 
      multicomponent exercise protocol using progressive loaded fundamental movement 
      patterns with prescribed work-to-rest intervals (1:3-2:1) in a circuit format (2-3 
      rounds). Muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, passive range of motion 
      (PRoM), static balance and functional movement screen (FMS®) were assessed at 
      baseline, 6 and 12 months following intervention. At post-training, all exercise 
      groups exhibited superior changes than CON in (i) muscular strength (+13%-38%, 
      p < 0.001); (ii) muscular endurance (+42%-159%, p < 0.001); (iii) flexibility 
      (+12%-42%, p < 0.001); (iv) PRoM (+6%-50%, p = 0.001-0.026); (v) static balance 
      (+61%-163%, p < 0.001); and (vi) FMS (+18%-39%, p < 0.001). Although a single 
      exercise session/week improved musculoskeletal fitness, changes demonstrated a 
      step-wise improvement with two and three sessions/week suggesting a dose-dependent 
      response. The response rate to training was 100% for all exercise groups. These 
      findings suggest that a multicomponent exercise approach incorporating bodyweight 
      drills and resistance-based alternative modes performed under real-world conditions 
      may improve several musculoskeletal fitness indicators in a dose-dependent manner in 
      inactive, middle-aged adults with overweight/obesity.Trial registration:

TI  - Effects of Movement Behaviors on Overall Health and Appetite Control: Current 
      Evidence and Perspectives in Children and Adolescents.
LID - 10.1007/s13679-021-00467-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To present the definitions and recommendations for movement 
      behaviors in children and adolescents, including physical activity (PA), sedentary 
      behaviors (SB), and sleep, and to provide an overview regarding their impact on 
      health and obesity outcomes from childhood to adulthood, as well as interactions 
      with appetite control. RECENT FINDINGS: PA represents a variable proportion of daily 
      energy expenditure and one can be active with high SB or vice versa. Studies have 
      described movements across the whole day on a continuum from sleep to SB to varying 
      intensities of PA. More PA, less SB (e.g., less screen time) and longer sleep are 
      positively associated with indicators of physical health (e.g., lower BMI, 
      adiposity, cardiometabolic risk) and cognitive development (e.g., motor skills, 
      academic achievement). However, less than 10% of children currently meet 
      recommendations for all three movement behaviors. Movement behaviors, adiposity, and 
      related cardiometabolic diseases in childhood track into adolescence and adulthood. 
      Furthermore, low PA/high SB profiles are associated with increased energy intake. 
      Recent studies investigating energy balance regulation showed that desirable 
      movement behavior profiles are associated with better appetite control and improved 
      eating habits. Early identification of behavioral phenotypes and a comprehensive 
      approach addressing all key behaviors that directly affect energy balance will allow 
      for individual strategies to prevent or treat obesity and its comorbidities. 
      Investigating exercise as a potential "corrector" of impaired appetite control 
      offers a promising weight management approach.

TI  - Falls Among People With Bilateral Vestibulopathy: A Review of Causes, Incidence, 
      Injuries, and Methods.
PG  - 187-192
LID - 10.1001/jamaoto.2021.3673 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: People with bilateral vestibulopathy experience severe balance and 
      mobility issues. Fear and anxiety are associated with reduced activity, which can 
      further affect balance and fall risk. Understanding and intervening on falls in this 
      population is essential. The aims of this narrative review are to provide an 
      overview of the current knowledge and applied methods on fall incidence, causes, and 
      injuries in bilateral vestibulopathy. OBSERVATIONS: Eleven articles reporting falls 
      incidence in people with bilateral vestibulopathy were deemed eligible, including 3 
      prospective and 8 retrospective studies, with a total of 359 participants, of whom 
      149 (42%) fell during the assessed period. When reported, the most common perceived 
      causes of falls were loss of balance, darkness, and uneven ground. Information on 
      sustained injuries was limited, with bruises and scrapes being the most common, and 
      only 4 fractures were reported. As most studies included falls as a secondary, 
      descriptive outcome measure, fall data obtained using best practice guidelines were 
      lacking. Only 6 studies reported their definition of a fall, of which 2 studies 
      explicitly reported the way participants were asked about their fall status. Only 3 
      studies performed a prospective daily fall assessment using monthly fall diaries (a 
      recommended practice), whereas the remaining studies retrospectively collected 
      fall-related data through questionnaires or interviews. While most studies reported 
      the number of people who did and did not fall, the number of total falls in 
      individual studies was lacking. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings from this 
      review suggest that falls in people with bilateral vestibulopathy are common but 
      remain an understudied consequence of the disease. Larger prospective studies that 
      follow best practice guidelines for fall data collection with the aim of obtaining 
      and reporting fall data are required to improve current fall risk assessments and 
      interventions in bilateral vestibulopathy.

TI  - Effect of mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants on glycaemic control, cardiovascular 
      health, and oxidative stress in humans: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 
      randomized controlled trials.
LID - 10.1111/dom.14669 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the effects of 
      mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants (mitoAOXs) on glycaemic control, cardiovascular 
      health, and oxidative stress outcomes in humans. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Randomized 
      controlled trials investigating mitoAOX interventions in humans were searched for in 
      databases (MEDLINE-PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE and Cochrane Library) and clinical trial 
      registries up to June 10, 2021. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk 
      of bias and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations were 
      used to assess trial quality and evidence certainty, respectively. RESULTS: Nineteen 
      studies (n = 884 participants) using mitoAOXs (including Elamipretide, mitoQ and 
      mitoTEMPO) were included in the review. There were limited studies investigating 
      effects of mitoAOXs on glycaemic control; and outcomes and population groups in 
      studies focussing on cardiovascular health were diverse. MitoAOXs significantly 
      improved brachial flow-mediated dilation (n = 3 trials; SMD: 1.19, 95% CI: 0.28, 
      2.16; I(2) : 67%) with very low evidence certainty. No significant effects were 
      found for any other glycaemic-, cardiovascular- or oxidative stress-related outcomes 
      with mitoAOXs in quantitative analyses, with evidence certainty rated mostly as low. 
      There was a lack of serious treatment-emergent adverse events with mitoAOXs, 
      although subcutaneous injection of Elamipretide increased mild-moderate 
      injection-site-related events. CONCLUSION: While short-term studies indicate that 
      mitoAOXs are generally well tolerated, there is currently limited evidence to 
      support the use of mitoAOXs in the management of glycaemic control and 
      cardiovascular health. Review findings suggest that future research should focus on 
      effects of mitoAOXs on glycaemic control and endothelial function in target clinical 
      population groups. (PROSPERO Registration: CRD42021253647). This article is

AB  - Child neglect (CN) has been associated with eating disorders, but little is known 
      about its prospective association with the eating habits (EHs) of children. This 
      study aimed to assess the cross-sectional and prospective associations of baseline 
      CN with six common EHs in Chinese primary schoolchildren. We analyzed two-wave data 
      of 1102 children (aged 9.1 ± 0.5 years) in Wuhan, China. Baseline CN was 
      investigated by the Child Neglect Scale. Baseline and follow-up EHs, including 
      fruit, vegetables, milk, sugar-sweetened beverages, and high-calorie snack and 
      breakfast consumption frequency, were assessed by the Food Frequency Questionnaires. 
      The association of baseline CN with baseline/follow-up EHs was analyzed by the 
      generalized linear model (GLM). The association of baseline CN with the change of 
      EHs from baseline to follow-up was examined by the Generalized estimating equation 
      (GEE) model. After adjusting for demographic characteristics, pubertal stage, and 
      body mass index, GLM indicated that higher baseline CN was associated with lower 
      frequency of consuming fruit/vegetables/milk/breakfast and higher frequency of 
      consuming sugar-sweetened beverages and high-calorie snacks at baseline, while it 
      was only associated with lower frequency of vegetables/breakfast consumption and 
      higher frequency of sugar-sweetened beverages consumption at follow-up. GEE results 
      indicated that children with higher CN had a more rapid increase for the frequency 
      of fruit/milk/breakfast consumption and a steeper decrease for the frequency of 
      sugar-sweetened beverages consumption. In conclusion, higher CN was associated with 
      unhealthy EHs. Yet simultaneously, children with higher CN have more scope to 
      promote the health of their EHs. Targeting and reducing CN may be a promising 
      approach for future interventions to improve subsequent EHs.

TI  - Zinc in depression: From development to treatment: A comparative/ dose response 
      meta-analysis of observational studies and randomized controlled trials.

LID - S0163-8343(20)30114-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.08.001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous meta-analysis suggested that zinc status may be linked to 
      depression status. However, it remains unclear whether zinc status can predict the 
      risk of depression development, or whether the monotherapy of zinc is superior to 
      the combination of zinc supplementation and antidepressant medications in the 
      treatment of depression. Therefore, this meta-analysis aimed to clarify the impact 
      of zinc status and supplementation on depression development and status across all 
      available evidence. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and ISI web of science were 
      searched, up to 14 May 2020, for relevant publications. Pooled relative risks (RRs) 
      with 95% confidence intervals (CI) in observational studies, and mean and standard 
      deviation (SD) for the change in depression score in RCTs were calculated using a 
      random-effects model. RESULTS: The meta-analysis of RCTs indicated that zinc 
      supplementation significantly lowered depressive symptom scores of depressed 
      patients [weighted mean difference (WMD = -4.15 point; 95% CI: -6.56, -1.75 point; 
      P < 0.01)], and the improvement in depression status occurred only when zinc 
      supplementation was prescribed as a monotherapy. The cohort studies showed that the 
      highest level of zinc intake was associated with a 28% reduced risk of depression 
      (RR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.82; I(2) = 13.90). Dose-response analyses revealed a 
      significant non-linear effect of baseline mood status on depression score. 
      CONCLUSION: Current evidence from observational studies and RCT's supports the 
      potential benefits zinc to reduce the risk of, and alleviate, depression. However, 
      further trials are needed to confirm the beneficial effect of zinc as a monotherapy 
      versus adjunctive therapies.

AB  - During COVID-19, there has been a surge in public interest for information on 
      immunity-boosting foods. There is little scientific support for immunity-supporting 
      properties of specific foods, but strong evidence for food choice impacts on other 
      health outcomes (e.g. risk of non-communicable disease) and environmental 
      sustainability. Here, we relate online recommendations for "immunity-boosting" foods 
      across five continents to their environmental and human health impacts. More 
      frequently recommended food items and groups are plant based and have lower land use 
      and greenhouse gas emission impacts plus more positive health outcomes (reducing 
      relative risks of mortality or chronic diet-related diseases) per serving of food. 
      We identify trade-offs between environmental outcomes of increasing consumption of 
      recommended food items, with aquatic environment impacts increasing with food 
      recommendation frequency. People's reliance on the Internet for health information 
      creates an opportunity to consolidate behaviour change towards consuming foods with 
      multiple co-benefits. Our study identifies win-win options for nudging online 
      information-seeking behaviour towards more sustainable choices for terrestrial 
      biodiversity conservation and human health.

AB  - RESEARCH QUESTION: Do maternal lifestyle factors influence the incidence of oocyte 
      dimorphisms and outcomes of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles? DESIGN: 
      A total of 752 female patients undergoing an ICSI cycle at a private 
      university-affiliated IVF centre from January 2015 to December 2019 were included in 
      this historical cohort study. Before starting ovarian stimulation, participants 
      completed a questionnaire on cigarette smoking habits, consumption of alcoholic 
      beverages, refined sugar, artificial sweeteners, soft drinks, fruits, legumes and 
      vegetables, milk and dairy, and meat, as well as exercise frequency over the past 6 
      months. Oocyte morphology was evaluated before ICSI. The influence of maternal 
      lifestyle factors on the incidence of oocyte dimorphisms and ICSI outcomes was 
      evaluated by multivariate general linear models and generalized linear models, 
      adjusted for potential confounders. The main outcome measures were the incidence of 
      oocyte dimorphisms per cycle and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Lifestyle factors and 
      nutritional habits such as cigarette smoking, and the consumption of alcohol, 
      refined sugar and artificial sweeteners, were positively associated with incidence 
      of several oocyte dimorphisms and negatively associated with the response to ovarian 
      stimulation and embryo development. Negative relationships were also observed 
      between these habits and clinical outcomes, apart from miscarriage rate, in which 
      positive relationships were observed. Significant negative dose-dependent 
      relationships between these habits and implantation rates were noted (P < 0.001). 
      Alcoholic beverage consumption also showed inverse dose-dependent relationships with 
      clinical pregnancy and live birth rates. Live birth rate was also negatively 
      associated with cigarette smoking, in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Poor 
      maternal habits were associated with reduced oocyte quality and ICSI outcomes in 
      this study. Many of these associations were shown to be dose-dependent.

TI  - Stress and the gut-brain axis: Cognitive performance, mood state, and biomarkers of 
      blood-brain barrier and intestinal permeability following severe physical and 
      psychological stress.

LID - S0889-1591(22)00027-7 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical and psychological stress alter gut-brain axis activity, 
      potentially causing intestinal barrier dysfunction that may, in turn, induce 
      cognitive and mood impairments through exacerbated inflammation and blood brain 
      barrier (BBB) permeability. These interactions are commonly studied in animals or 
      artificial laboratory environments. However, military survival training provides an 
      alternative and unique human model for studying the impacts of severe physical and 
      psychological stress on the gut-brain axis in a realistic environment. PURPOSE: To 
      determine changes in intestinal barrier and BBB permeability during stressful 
      military survival training and identify relationships between those changes and 
      markers of stress, inflammation, cognitive performance, and mood state. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Seventy-one male U.S. Marines (25.2 ± 2.6 years) were studied during 
      Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) training. Measurements were 
      conducted on day 2 of the 10-day classroom phase of training (PRE), following 
      completion of the 7.5-day field-based simulation phase of the training (POST), and 
      following a 27-day recovery period (REC). Fat-free mass (FFM) was measured to assess 
      the overall physiologic impact of the training. Biomarkers of intestinal 
      permeability (liposaccharide-binding protein [LBP]) and BBB permeability (S100 
      calcium-binding protein B [S100B]), stress (cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate 
      [DHEA-S] epinephrine, norepinephrine) and inflammation (interleukin-6 [IL-6], 
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]) were measured in blood. Cognitive 
      performance was assessed by psychomotor vigilance (PVT) and grammatical reasoning 
      (GR) tests, and mood state by the Profile of Mood States (total mood disturbance; 
      TMD), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Patient Health (PHQ-9) questionnaires. 
      RESULTS: FFM, psychomotor vigilance, and LBP decreased from PRE to POST, while TMD, 
      anxiety, and depression scores, and S100B, DHEA-S, IL-6, norepinephrine, and 
      epinephrine concentrations all increased (all p ≤ 0.01). Increases in DHEA-S were 
      associated with decreases in body mass (p = 0.015). Decreases in FFM were associated 
      with decreases in LBP concentrations (p = 0.015), and both decreases in FFM and LBP 
      were associated with increases in TMD and depression scores (all p < 0.05) but not 
      with changes in cognitive performance. Conversely, increases in S100B concentrations 
      were associated with decreases in psychomotor vigilance (p < 0.05) but not with 
      changes in mood state or LBP concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of increased 
      intestinal permeability was not observed in this military survival training-based 
      model of severe physical and psychological stress. However, increased BBB 
      permeability was associated with stress and cognitive decline, while FFM loss was 
      associated with mood disturbance, suggesting that distinct mechanisms may contribute 
      to decrements in cognitive performance and mood state during the severe physical and 
      psychological stress experienced during military survival training.

LID - 10.1093/ajcn/nqac022 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids and home exercise on fall 
      prevention among generally healthy and active older adults is unclear. OBJECTIVES: 
      To test the effect of daily supplemental vitamin D, marine omega-3 s fatty acids and 
      a simple home exercise program (SHEP), alone or in combination, on the incidence of 
      total and injurious falls among generally healthy older adults. METHODS: We 
      performed a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial design randomized-controlled trial among 2157 
      community-dwelling adults age 70 years and older, who had no major health events in 
      the five years prior to enrolment, recruited from Switzerland, Germany, Austria, 
      France, and Portugal between December 2012 and November 2014. Participants were 
      randomly assigned to 2000 international units/day of vitamin D3 and/or 1 g/day of 
      marine omega-3 s, and/or a SHEP versus placebo and/or control exercise over three 
      years. The primary endpoint for the present fall analysis was the incidence rate of 
      total falls. Falls were recorded prospectively throughout the trial. Since there 
      were no interactions between treatments, main effects are reported based on modified 
      intent-to-treat. RESULTS: Of 2157 randomized participants, 1900 (88%) completed the 
      study. The mean age was 74.9 years, 61.7% were women, 40.7% had serum 
      25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration < 20 ng/ml, and 83% were at least moderately 
      physically active. In total, 3333 falls were recorded over a median follow-up of 
      2.99 years. Overall, vitamin D and SHEP had no benefit on total falls, whilst 
      omega-3 s compared to no omega-3 s reduced total falls by 10% (incidence rate ratio 
      [IRR] = 0.90, 95% confidence interval [0.81, 1.00], P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Among 
      generally healthy, active and vitamin D-replete older adults, supplemental omega-3 s 
      may have a modest benefit on the incidence of total falls, whilst daily high-dose 
      vitamin D or SHEP had no benefit. Trial registration number: NCT01745263 URL of

AB  - Results in rowing have improved and here we estimate results for Olympic and World 
      rowing championships based on the winning results from 1893 to 2019 obtained in the 
      current seven Olympic events for men (n = 556) and women (n = 239). Data were 
      collected from the official World Rowing Federation online records and from 
      published results and the development analysed by linear regression analysis for the 
      year of competition. Results improved by about 0.7 s per year (15 ± 9.4%) (mean ± 
      SD). Depending on the event, 2020 predicted mean time for the winning boat for men 
      is 363 s (range 326-397) vs. 404 s (362-439) for women (10.3 ± 1.1% slower). The 
      ten-year coefficient of variance for the original boats in Olympic and World Rowing 
      Federation regatta remaining within the Olympic programme, single scull and eight, 
      decreased from 9 ± 2% (1893-1903) to 2 ± 0.4% (2009-2019). Reduced variability in 
      winning times illustrates the standardization of the rowing course and boats, and 
      the improvement in performance point to that body size becomes ever more important 
      for success in competitive rowing.

TI  - High-Repetition-Rate Transient Absorption Spectroscopy of Respiratory 
      Supercomplexes.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c08714 [doi]
AB  - Hemeproteins are frequent subjects for ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy 
      (TAS) because of biological importance, strong UV-vis absorption, high 
      photostability, and interesting transient dynamics that depend on redox, 
      conformation, and ligand binding. TAS on hemeproteins is usually performed on 
      isolated, purified proteins, though their response is likely to be different in 
      their native molecular environment, which involves the formation of protein 
      complexes and supercomplexes. Recently, we reported a transient absorption 
      microscopy (TAM) experiment which elicited a transient response from hemeproteins in 
      intact biological tissue using a visible-wavelength pump (530 nm) and probe (490 
      nm). Here, we find that adaptive noise canceling plus resonant galvanometer scanning 
      enables a high-repetition-rate fiber laser source to make redox-sensitive 
      measurements of cytochrome c (Cyt-c). We investigate the origins of the 
      visible-wavelength response of biological tissue through TAS of intact mitochondrial 
      respiratory supercomplexes, separated via gel electrophoresis. We find that each of 
      these high-molecular-weight gel bands yields a TAS response characteristic of 
      cytochrome hemes, implying that the TAS response of intact cells and tissue 
      originates from not just Cyt-c but a mixture of respiratory cytochromes. We also 
      find differences in excited-state lifetime between wild-type (WT) and a 
      tafazzin-deficient (TAZ) mouse model of mitochondrial disease.

TI  - Levels and correlates of physical activity and capacity among HIV-infected compared 
      to HIV-uninfected individuals.
PG  - e0262298

LID - e0262298
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the HIV-infected individuals, physical activity improves physical 
      strength, quality of life and reduces the risk of developing non-communicable 
      diseases. In Sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-infected patients report being less active 
      compared to HIV-uninfected individuals. We assessed the levels and correlates of 
      objectively measured physical activity and capacity among HIV-infected 
      antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals compared to HIV-uninfected 
      individuals in Mwanza, Tanzania. METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional study among 
      newly diagnosed HIV-infected ART-naive individuals and HIV-uninfected individuals 
      frequency-matched for age and sex. Socio-demographic data, anthropometrics, CD4 
      counts, haemoglobin level, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were collected. Physical 
      activity energy expenditure (PAEE) was assessed as measure of physical activity 
      whereas sleeping heart rate (SHR) and grip strength were assessed as measures of 
      physical capacity. Multivariable linear regression was used to assess the correlates 
      associated with physical activity and capacity. RESULTS: A total of 272 HIV-infected 
      and 119 HIV-uninfected individuals, mean age 39 years and 60% women participated in 
      the study. Compared to HIV-uninfected individuals, HIV-infected had poorer physical 
      activity and capacity: lower PAEE (-7.3 kj/kg/day, 95% CI: -11.2, -3.3), elevated 
      SHR (7.7 beats/min, 95%CI: 10.1, 5.3) and reduced grip strength (-4.7 kg, 95%CI: 
      -6.8, -2.8). In HIV-infected individuals, low body mass index, moderate-severe 
      anaemia, low CD4 counts and high CRP were associated with lower physical activity 
      and capacity. In HIV-uninfected individuals, abdominal obesity and moderate anaemia 
      were associated with lower physical activity and capacity. CONCLUSION: HIV-infected 
      participants had lower levels of physical activity and capacity than HIV-uninfected 
      participants. Correlates of physical activity and capacity differed by HIV status. 
      Management of HIV and related conditions needs to be provided effectively in health 
      care facilities. Interventions promoting physical activity in these populations will 
      be of importance to improve their health and reduce the risk of non-communicable 
      diseases.

AB  - Ovarian cancer is routinely diagnosed long after the disease has metastasized 
      through the fibrous sub-mesothelium. Despite extensive research in the field linking 
      ovarian cancer progression to increasingly poor prognosis, there are currently no 
      validated cellular markers or hallmarks of ovarian cancer that can predict 
      metastatic potential. To discern disease progression across a syngeneic mouse 
      ovarian cancer progression model, here, we fabricated extracellular-matrix mimicking 
      suspended fiber networks: crosshatches of mismatch diameters for studying protrusion 
      dynamics, aligned same diameter networks of varying inter-fiber spacing for studying 
      migration, and aligned nanonets for measuring cell forces. We found that migration 
      correlated with disease, while force-disease biphasic relationship exhibited f-actin 
      stress-fiber network dependence. However, unique to suspended fibers, coiling 
      occurring at tips of protrusions and not the length or breadth of protrusions 
      displayed strongest correlation with metastatic potential. To confirm that our 
      findings were more broadly applicable beyond the mouse model, we repeated our 
      studies in human ovarian cancer cell lines and found that the biophysical trends 
      were consistent with our mouse model results. Altogether, we report complementary 
      high throughput and high content biophysical metrics capable of identifying ovarian 
      cancer metastatic potential on time scale of hours. [Media: see text] [Media: see

TI  - Can the ketogenic diet lead to Wernicke's encephalopathy?
LID - 10.3233/PRM-200731 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE), a neurological disorder due to the 
      deficiency of thiamine, is often underdiagnosed in the pediatric population. The 
      classic triad of mental status changes, oculomotor abnormality, and ataxia is 
      observed in only 16-21% of all pediatric presentations. Wernicke's is most often 
      associated with alcohol dependence, but also malignancy, parenteral nutrition, and 
      gastrointestinal (GI) malformations. The correlation between following a Ketogenic 
      diet and acquiring Wernicke's, however, has not previously been reported. CASE 
      REPORT: A 16-year-old previously healthy male presented with an eleven-day history 
      of neurological deficits and GI upset. The patient had recently lost one hundred 
      pounds while following a "ketogenic" diet. He was subsequently diagnosed with 
      Wernicke's, received intravenous thiamine, and was transferred to the inpatient 
      rehabilitation, where he received extensive diet education. After making significant 
      functional improvement, he was discharged home. RELEVANCE: This case illustrates the 
      importance of including Wernicke's in the differential diagnosis when a pediatric 
      patient presents with neurological deficits after rapid weight loss. Wernicke's 
      encephalopathy may be fatal in the pediatric population, therefore, it must be 
      treated immediately if clinically suspected. Children presenting with Wernicke's 
      would benefit from early intervention, intensive inpatient rehabilitation, and 
      comprehensive education regarding the role of food and exercise on weight loss and 
      health.

TI  - Effects of 18-months metformin versus placebo in combination with three insulin 
      regimens on RNA and DNA oxidation in individuals with type 2 diabetes: A post-hoc 
      analysis of a randomized clinical trial.

AB  - Formation of reactive oxygen species has been linked to the development of diabetes 
      complications. Treatment with metformin has been associated with a lower risk of 
      developing diabetes complications, including when used in combination with insulin. 
      Metformin inhibits Complex 1 in isolated mitochondria and thereby decreases the 
      formation of reactive oxygen species. Thus, we post-hoc investigated the effect of 
      metformin in combination with different insulin regimens on RNA and DNA oxidation in 
      individuals with type 2 diabetes. Four hundred and fifteen individuals with type 2 
      diabetes were randomized (1:1) to blinded treatment with metformin (1,000 mg twice 
      daily) versus placebo and to (1:1:1) open-label biphasic insulin, basal-bolus 
      insulin, or basal insulin therapy in a 2 × 3 factorial design. RNA and DNA oxidation 
      were determined at baseline and after 18 months measured as urinary excretions of 
      8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoGuo) and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine 
      (8-oxodG), respectively. Urinary excretion of 8-oxoGuo changed by +7.1% (95% CI: 
      0.5% to 14.0%, P = 0.03) following metformin versus placebo, whereas changes in 
      8-oxodG were comparable between intervention groups. Biphasic insulin decreased 
      urinary excretion of 8-oxoGuo (within-group: -9.6% (95% CI: -14.4% to -4.4%)) more 
      than basal-bolus insulin (within-group: 5.2% (95% CI: -0.5% to 11.2%)), P = 0.0002 
      between groups, and basal insulin (within-group: 3.7% (95% CI: -2.0% to 9.7%)), 
      P = 0.0007 between groups. Urinary excretion of 8-oxodG decreased more in the 
      biphasic insulin group (within-group: -9.9% (95% CI: -14.4% to -5.2%)) than 
      basal-bolus insulin (within group effect: -1.2% (95% CI: -6.1% to 3.9%)), P = 0.01 
      between groups, whereas no difference was observed compared with basal insulin. In 
      conclusion, eighteen months of metformin treatment in addition to different insulin 
      regimens increased RNA oxidation, but not DNA oxidation. Biphasic insulin decreased 
      both RNA and DNA oxidation compared with other insulin regimens.

TI  - Human Blood Lipoprotein Predictions from (1)H NMR Spectra: Protocol, Model 
      Performances, and Cage of Covariance.
PG  - 628-636
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.1c01654 [doi]
AB  - Lipoprotein subfractions are biomarkers for the early diagnosis of cardiovascular 
      diseases. The reference method, ultracentrifugation, for measuring lipoproteins is 
      time-consuming, and there is a need to develop a rapid method for cohort screenings. 
      This study presents partial least-squares regression models developed using (1)H 
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra and concentrations of lipoproteins as 
      measured by ultracentrifugation on 316 healthy Danes. This study explores, for the 
      first time, different regions of the (1)H NMR spectrum representing signals of 
      molecules in lipoprotein particles and different lipid species to develop 
      parsimonious, reliable, and optimal prediction models. A total of 65 lipoprotein 
      main and subfractions were predictable with high accuracy, Q(2) of >0.6, using an 
      optimal spectral region (1.4-0.6 ppm) containing methylene and methyl signals from 
      lipids. The models were subsequently tested on an independent cohort of 290 healthy 
      Swedes with predicted and reference values matching by up to 85-95%. In addition, an 
      open software tool was developed to predict lipoproteins concentrations in human 
      blood from standardized (1)H NMR spectral recordings.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the risk of ankle OA onset after an 
      incidence of sprain, relative to the risk of onset in healthy population, and to 
      investigate the effect of gender, age, BMI, and exercise on the development of ankle 
      OA after sprain. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Using a sample cohort 
      dataset from 2002 to 2013 provided by the Korean National Health Insurance Sharing 
      Service, we calculated the mean survival time and cumulative incidence rate in 
      sprained and healthy populations using Kaplan-Meier analysis. A Cox proportional 
      hazards model was used to analyze the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of sprain for the 
      development of OA with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Adjusted HRs of gender, age, 
      BMI, and exercise (yes/no) were analyzed in the sprained group. RESULTS: Among the 
      selected population of 195,393 individuals, 40,876 (20.9%) were diagnosed with an 
      ankle sprain, and 1543 (3.85%) of those individuals developed ankle OA. Of the 
      154,517 healthy individuals (79.1%), 4062 (2.66%) cases had progressed to OA. The 
      sprained group had 46% (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.38-1.55) greater rate of progression to 
      ankle OA than did healthy individuals. In the sprain group, individuals who were 
      female, obese, and overweight had 40% (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.26-1.55), 43% (HR, 1.43; 
      95% CI, 1.12-1.82), and 22% (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.10-1.35) higher incidence to 
      develop ankle OA, respectively, compared to those who were male, underweight and 
      normal. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that ankle sprain was a significant risk 
      factor for a diagnosis of early OA. Female gender and high BMI increased the 
      incidence of ankle OA after sprain.

TI  - Two-year administration of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor brought about 
      marked reduction of body fat independent of skeletal muscle amount or glycemic 
      improvement in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 117-123

AB  - AIM: To investigate long-term effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor 
      (SGLT2i) on anthropometric and metabolic factors in Japanese patients with type 2 
      diabetes (T2DM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective observation study. 
      Forty-six outpatients with T2DM (32 men and 14 women, 51 ± 13 years old, BMI 
      27.9 ± 4.8, means ± S.D.) who had been treated by SGLT2i for 2 years were selected 
      and their metabolic and anthropometric data were retrieved from medical records 
      retrospectively. Regular instruction for diet and exercise had been performed 
      throughout the administration of SGLT2i in outpatient clinic basis. RESULTS: By the 
      administration of SGLT2i for 2 years, body weight and body fat amount were 
      significantly reduced (P < 0.0001) in spite of no change in skeletal muscle mass. 
      HbA1c (P < 0.0001), liver function and lipid profile (P < 0.01) were ameliorated and 
      eGFR was reduced significantly (P < 0.0001). It is of note that the reduction of 
      body weight was strongly correlated to that of body fat (r = 0.951, P < 0.0001) with 
      no correlation to the change of skeletal muscle mass. The reduction of HbA1c was 
      strongly correlated to the baseline HbA1c (r =  - 0.922, P < 0.0001) and modestly 
      correlated to the baseline eGFR (r =  - 0.449, P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis 
      revealed a weak relationship between the amelioration of HbA1c and the reduction of 
      body weight. CONCLUSION: SGLT2i can effectively reduce body weight and body fat mass 
      independent of the blood glucose improvement or the renal function. Under the 
      periodical instruction for nutrition and exercise this oral hypoglycemic agent can 
      be safely administered for a long term without a risk for sarcopenia.

TI  - Four weeks of electrical stimulation improves glucose tolerance in a sedentary 
      overweight or obese Hispanic population.
LID - e210533 [pii]
LID - 10.1530/EC-21-0533 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE: Most US adults (54%) do not meet the minimum exercise 
      recommendations by the American College of Sports Medicine. Neuromuscular electrical 
      stimulation (NMES) is a novel alternate strategy to induce muscle contraction. 
      However, the effectiveness of NMES to improve insulin sensitivity and energy 
      expenditure is unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 
      4 weeks of NMES on glucose tolerance in a sedentary overweight or obese population. 
      METHODS: Participants (n = 10; age: 36.8 ± 3.8 years; BMI = 32 ± 1.3 kg/m2) were 
      randomized into either control or NMES group. All participants received bilateral 
      quadriceps stimulation (12 sessions; 30 min/session; three times/week at 50 Hz and 
      300 µs pulse width) altering pulse amplitude to either provide low-intensity sensory 
      level (control; tingling sensation) or at high-intensity neuromuscular level (NMES; 
      maximum tolerable levels with visible muscle contraction). Glucose tolerance was 
      assessed by a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and substrate utilization was 
      measured by indirect calorimetry and body composition via dual X-ray absorptiometry 
      at baseline and after 4 weeks of NMES intervention. RESULTS: Control and NMES groups 
      had comparable fasting blood glucose, glucose tolerance, substrate utilization, and 
      muscle mass at baseline. Four weeks of NMES resulted in a significant improvement in 
      glucose tolerance measured by OGTT, whereas no change was observed in the control 
      group. There was no change in substrate utilization and muscle mass in both control 
      and NMES groups. CONCLUSION: NMES is a novel and effective strategy to improve 
      glucose tolerance in an at-risk overweight or obese sedentary population.

TI  - Association between skeletal muscle mass and quality of life in adults with cancer: 
      a systematic review and meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1002/jcsm.12928 [doi]
AB  - Low skeletal muscle mass is known to be associated with poor morbidity and mortality 
      outcomes in cancer, but evidence of its impact on health-related quality of life 
      (HRQOL) is less established. This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed 
      to investigate the relationship between skeletal muscle mass and HRQOL in adults 
      with cancer. Five databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase via Ovid, CINAHL plus, Scopus, and 
      PsycInfo) were systematically searched from 1 January 2007 until 2 September 2020. 
      Studies reporting on the association between measures of skeletal muscle (mass 
      and/or radiodensity) derived from analysis of computed tomography imaging, and a 
      validated measure of HRQOL in adults with cancer, were considered for inclusion. 
      Studies classifying skeletal muscle mass as a categorical variable (low or normal) 
      were combined in a meta-analysis to investigate cross-sectional association with 
      HRQOL. Studies reporting skeletal muscle as a continuous variable were qualitatively 
      synthesized. A total of 14 studies involving 2776 participants were eligible for 
      inclusion. Skeletal muscle mass classified as low or normal was used to dichotomize 
      participants in 10 studies (n = 1375). Five different cut points were used for 
      classification across the 10 studies, with low muscle mass attributed to 58% of 
      participants. Low muscle mass was associated with poorer global HRQOL scores 
      [n = 985 from seven studies, standardized mean difference -0.27, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) -0.40 to -0.14, P < 0.0001], and poorer physical functioning domain 
      HRQOL scores (n = 507 from five studies, standardized mean difference -0.40, 95% CI 
      -0.74 to -0.05, P = 0.02), but not social, role, emotional, or cognitive functioning 
      domain scores (all P > 0.05). Five studies examined the cross-sectional relationship 
      between HRQOL and skeletal muscle mass as a continuous variable and found little 
      evidence of an association unless non-linear analysis was used. Two studies 
      investigated the relationship between longitudinal changes in both skeletal muscle 
      and HRQOL, reporting that an association exists across several HRQOL domains. Low 
      muscle mass may be associated with lower global and physical functioning HRQOL 
      scores in adults with cancer. The interpretation of this relationship is limited by 
      the varied classification of low muscle mass between studies. There is a need for 
      prospective, longitudinal studies examining the interplay between skeletal muscle 
      mass and HRQOL over time, and data should be made accessible to enable reanalysis 
      according to different cut points. Further research is needed to elucidate the 
      causal pathways between these outcomes.

TI  - Oral and intravenous glucose administration elicit opposing microvascular blood flow 
      responses in skeletal muscle of healthy people: role of incretins.
LID - 10.1113/JP282428 [doi]
AB  - Insulin infusion increases skeletal muscle microvascular blood flow (MBF) in healthy 
      people but is impaired during insulin resistance. However, we have shown that 
      eliciting insulin secretion via oral glucose loading in healthy people impairs 
      muscle MBF, whilst others have demonstrated intravenous glucose infusion stimulates 
      MBF. We aimed to show that the route of glucose administration (oral versus 
      intravenous) influences muscle MBF, and explore potential gut-derived hormones that 
      may explain these divergent responses. Ten healthy individuals underwent a 120 min 
      oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; 75 g glucose) and on a subsequent occasion an 
      intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT, bypassing the gut) matched for similar 
      blood glucose excursions. Femoral artery and thigh muscle microvascular 
      (contrast-enhanced ultrasound) haemodynamics were measured at baseline and during 
      the OGTT/IVGTT. Plasma insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, non-esterified fatty acids and 
      a range of gut-derived hormones and incretins (gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) 
      and glucagon-like peptide-1(GLP-1)) were measured at baseline and throughout the 
      OGTT/IVGTT. The IVGTT increased whereas the OGTT impaired MBF (1.3-fold versus 
      0.5-fold from baseline, respectively, P = 0.0006). The impairment in MBF during the 
      OGTT occurred despite producing 2.8-fold higher plasma insulin concentrations 
      (P = 0.0001). The change in MBF from baseline (ΔMBF) negatively correlated with ΔGIP 
      concentrations (r = -0.665, P < 0.0001). The natural log ratio of incretins 
      GLP-1:GIP was positively associated with ΔMBF (r = 0.658, P < 0.0001), suggesting 
      they have opposing actions on the microvasculature. Postprandial hyperglycaemia per 
      se does not acutely determine opposing microvascular responses between OGTT and 
      IVGTT. Incretins may play a role in modulating skeletal muscle MBF in humans. KEY 
      POINTS: Insulin or mixed nutrient meals stimulate skeletal muscle microvascular 
      blood flow (MBF) to aid in the delivery of nutrients; however, this vascular effect 
      is lost during insulin resistance. Food/drinks containing large glucose loads impair 
      MBF in healthy people; however, this impairment is not observed when glucose is 
      infused intravenously (bypassing the gut). We investigated skeletal muscle MBF 
      responses to a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and intravenous glucose infusion and 
      aimed to identify potential gut hormones responsible for glucose-mediated changes in 
      MBF. Despite similar blood glucose concentrations, orally ingested glucose impaired, 
      whereas intravenously infused glucose augmented, skeletal muscle MBF. The incretin 
      gastric inhibitory polypeptide was negatively associated with MBF, suggestive of an 
      incretin-mediated MBF response to oral glucose ingestion. This work provides new 
      insight into why diets high in glucose may be detrimental to vascular health and 
      provides new avenues for novel treatment strategies targeting microvascular 
      dysfunction.

AB  - PURPOSE: Despite recommendations that children accrue ≥60 min/day of 
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), numerous barriers may exist. We 
      examined school-day MVPA patterns in lower-income children (pre-K to 5th grade) to 
      determine whether they were meeting the minimum school-day guidelines of at least 
      30-min/day of MVPA and to identify opportunities for intervention. METHODS: Students 
      (N = 629, pre-K-5th grade) from 4 urban schools wore Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers 
      over 2 school days. Mixed effects models evaluated sex- and grade-specific 
      differences in MVPA and sedentary time. RESULTS: Only 34.6% of elementary and 25.3% 
      of pre-K students met the school-time MVPA recommendation. Among elementary-aged 
      children, boys accrued more MVPA than girls (30.8 ± 13.3 vs. 23.5 ± 10.7 min/day; p 
      < 0.0001) with similar sex differences observed among pre-K children (51.3 ± 17.1 vs 
      41.9 ± 17.5 min/day; p < 0.001). Sedentary time also increased significantly with 
      grade among elementary-aged children (207.9 ± 34.7 vs. 252.0 ± 36.1 min/day for 
      those in 1st and 5th grade, respectively; p < 0.001), with girls accruing more 
      sedentary time than boys (242.5 ± 48.2 vs. 233.8 ± 46.8 min/day; p < 0.0001). 
      CONCLUSION: MVPA declines across elementary school years, with sex disparities 
      observed as early as pre-K. Extended sedentary bouts and clustering of activity 
      highlight opportunities for more movement throughout the school day.

AB  - In this study, we aimed to analyse the relationship between body composition and 
      bioelectrical variables in children and adolescents. The sample was composed of 6801 
      individuals (4035 males; 2766 females) aged 8-20 years included in the National 
      Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) years 1999-2004. Classic and 
      specific bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) were applied and compared 
      with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for the evaluation of fat mass (FM) and 
      fat-free mass (FFM), and bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) for the evaluation of 
      intra-cellular water (ICW), extra-cellular water (ECW), and total body water (TBW). 
      Fat-free mass index (FFMI) was calculated. Spearman's correlation, regression, and 
      depth-depth analyses were applied. The evaluation of body composition with BIVA 
      agreed well with that of DXA or BIS, independently of sex, age, and ethnicity: 
      classic BIVA was mostly sensitive to differences in TBW, ECW/ICW, whereas specific 
      BIVA to differences in %FM, FFMI, and ECW/ICW. The depth-depth analysis confirmed 
      the associations of classic BIVA (coeff. 0.500, p < 0.001), and specific BIVA 
      (coeff. 0.512, p < 0.001), also considering the significant effect of age 
      (p < 0.001). In classic BIVA the association was slightly stronger in females (by 
      0.03, p = 0.042) and among Blacks (0.06, p = 0.002), whereas in specific BIVA it was 
      stronger by 0.06 (p < 0.001) in females and similar among ethnic groups. The 
      combined use of the two BIVA approaches represents a valuable tool for complete 
      evaluation of body composition in growth studies, for the prevention and monitoring 
      of malnutrition, and the monitoring of the performance in young athletes.

AB  - Abdominal obesity is a critical factor for metabolic diseases, and specific eating 
      patterns such as the Mediterranean diet help prevent metabolic diseases. This study 
      aimed to investigate the association between the modified Korean health eating index 
      (MKHEI), including a Korean-balanced diet, and abdominal obesity risk according to 
      genders in adults aged 20-64 years (4,886 males and 7,431 females), using the Korea 
      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey VI (2013-2016). Adjusted means and 
      95% confidence intervals of MKHEI scores and nutrient intake estimated using the 
      24-h recall method were calculated according to abdominal obesity (waist 
      circumference ≥90 cm for men and ≥85 cm for women) after adjusting for age, 
      residence area, region, education, income, drinking status, smoking status, marital 
      status, and exercise. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for abdominal obesity were measured 
      according to MKHEI tertiles using logistic regression analysis while controlling for 
      covariates. Individuals aged >50 years, married, below high school, lower-income, 
      heavy alcohol drinkers, past and current smokers, and males living in the southern 
      areas had a higher risk of abdominal obesity. In both genders, the scores of all 
      MKHEI components were lower in the abdominal obesity group (n = 2,895) than in the 
      control group (n = 9,422). Further, the scores of fruits with and without fruit 
      juice and those of beans, including fermented beans, were lower in the abdominal 
      obesity group only in females but not in males. Further, the scores of fast foods 
      were higher in the abdominal obesity group than in the control group only in 
      females. After adjusting for covariates, the adjusted OR for abdominal obesity was 
      inversely associated with Korean balanced diet (KBD) related to KHEI scores. Unlike 
      KBD, MKHEI of Western-style diet was not associated with abdominal obesity in either 
      gender. In conclusion, KBD can lower the risk of abdominal obesity in females and 
      should thus be recommended to prevent abdominal obesity.

TI  - Impaired postprandial skeletal muscle vascular responses to a mixed meal challenge 
      in normoglycaemic people with a parent with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 216-225
LID - 10.1007/s00125-021-05572-7 [doi]
AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Microvascular blood flow (MBF) increases in skeletal muscle 
      postprandially to aid in glucose delivery and uptake in muscle. This vascular action 
      is impaired in individuals who are obese or have type 2 diabetes. Whether MBF is 
      impaired in normoglycaemic people at risk of type 2 diabetes is unknown. We aimed to 
      determine whether apparently healthy people at risk of type 2 diabetes display 
      impaired skeletal muscle microvascular responses to a mixed-nutrient meal. METHODS: 
      In this cross-sectional study, participants with no family history of type 2 
      diabetes (FH-) for two generations (n = 18), participants with a positive family 
      history of type 2 diabetes (FH+; i.e. a parent with type 2 diabetes; n = 16) and 
      those with type 2 diabetes (n = 12) underwent a mixed meal challenge (MMC). 
      Metabolic responses (blood glucose, plasma insulin and indirect calorimetry) were 
      measured before and during the MMC. Skeletal muscle large artery haemodynamics (2D 
      and Doppler ultrasound, and Mobil-O-graph) and microvascular responses 
      (contrast-enhanced ultrasound) were measured at baseline and 1 h post MMC. RESULTS: 
      Despite normal blood glucose concentrations, FH+ individuals displayed impaired 
      metabolic flexibility (reduced ability to switch from fat to carbohydrate oxidation 
      vs FH-; p < 0.05) during the MMC. The MMC increased forearm muscle microvascular 
      blood volume in both the FH- (1.3-fold, p < 0.01) and FH+ (1.3-fold, p < 0.05) 
      groups but not in participants with type 2 diabetes. However, the MMC increased MBF 
      (1.9-fold, p < 0.01), brachial artery diameter (1.1-fold, p < 0.01) and brachial 
      artery blood flow (1.7-fold, p < 0.001) and reduced vascular resistance (0.7-fold, 
      p < 0.001) only in FH- participants, with these changes being absent in FH+ and type 
      2 diabetes. Participants with type 2 diabetes displayed significantly higher 
      vascular stiffness (p < 0.001) compared with those in the FH- and FH+ groups; 
      however, vascular stiffness did not change during the MMC in any participant group. 
      CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Normoglycaemic FH+ participants display impaired 
      postprandial skeletal muscle macro- and microvascular responses, suggesting that 
      poor vascular responses to a meal may contribute to their increased risk of type 2 
      diabetes. We conclude that vascular insulin resistance may be an early precursor to 
      type 2 diabetes in humans, which can be revealed using an MMC.

TI  - Extra virgin olive oil high in polyphenols improves antioxidant status in adults: a 
      double-blind, randomized, controlled, cross-over study (OLIVAUS).
PG  - 1073-1086
LID - 10.1007/s00394-021-02712-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Olive oil polyphenols have been associated with cardiovascular health 
      benefits. This study examined the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect of 
      extra-virgin high polyphenol olive oil (HPOO) vs. low polyphenol olive oil (LPOO) in 
      healthy Australian adults. METHODS: In a double-blind cross-over trial, 50 
      participants (aged 38.5 ± 13.9 years, 66% females) were randomized to consume 
      60 mL/day of HPOO (320 mg/kg polyphenols) or LPOO (86 mg/kg polyphenols) for three 
      weeks. Following a 2-week wash-out period, participants crossed-over to the 
      alternate treatment. Plasma oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), total 
      antioxidant capacity (TAC), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and 
      anthropometrics were measured at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: Fourty-three 
      participants completed the study. Although there were no significant differences 
      between treatments in the total sample, plasma ox-LDL decreased by 6.5 mU/mL (95%CI 
      - 12.4 to - 0.5) and TAC increased by 0.03 mM (95% CI 0.006-0.05) only in the HPOO 
      arm. Stratified analyses were also performed by cardiovascular disease risk status 
      defined by abdominal obesity (WC > 94 cm in males, > 80 cm in females) or 
      inflammation (hs-CRP > 1 mg/L). In the subgroup with abdominal obesity, ox-LDL 
      decreased by 13.5 mU/mL (95% CI - 23.5 to - 3.6) and TAC increased by 0.04 mM (95% 
      CI 0.006-0.07) only after HPOO consumption. In the subgroup with inflammation, 
      hs-CRP decreased by 1.9 mg/L (95% CI - 3.7 to -0.1) only in the HPOO arm. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although there were no significant differences between treatments, the 
      changes observed after HPOO consumption demonstrate the antioxidant and 
      anti-inflammatory effect of this oil, which is more pronounced in adults with high 
      cardiometabolic risk (Clinical Trial Registration: ACTRN12618000706279).

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of adjunct non-pharmacological interventions on maternal 
      and neonatal outcomes in gestational diabetes mellitus patients: A systematic review 
      and network meta-analysis protocol of randomized controlled trials.
PG  - e0263336
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0263336 [doi]
LID - e0263336
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in pregnancy leads to a range of 
      perinatal complications. Although several randomized controlled trials (RCT) have 
      tested the effect of non-pharmacological standard GDM care adjuncts on these 
      outcomes, there is no agglomerated statistical evidence on how their occurrence risk 
      varies across interventions and with placebo. Therefore, a systematic review and 
      network meta-analysis (NMA) protocol is proposed here to address this evidence gap. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search for above RCTs published in the English language 
      will transpire in PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases irrespective of date and 
      geographic boundary. The RCTs must test nutritional supplementation, digital 
      intervention, structured exercise program, educational program, counseling service, 
      or a combination of these prenatally in GDM patients. These should report ≥1 of the 
      following outcomes- cesarean section, pre-eclampsia, polyhydramnios, preterm birth, 
      macrosomia, prolonged labor, gestational hypertension, premature rupture of 
      membranes, congenital anomaly, Apgar scores, birth weight, birth length, gestational 
      age at birth, neonatal hypoglycemia, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and neonatal 
      Corpulence Index. The risk of bias assessment of the recruited trials will transpire 
      using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Determination of the comparative 
      effectiveness between interventions will occur by the frequentist method NMA for 
      respective outcomes. The categorical and continuous outcomes effect size will get 
      calculated in risk ratio and weighted or standardized mean difference, respectively. 
      For each NMA model, network maps and league tables will show the connections between 
      interventions and effect sizes with their 95% confidence intervals for each 
      intervention pair compared, respectively. The publication bias assessment will occur 
      using comparison-adjusted funnel plots. Best intervention prediction for NMA models 
      with statistically significant intervention effect will happen by determining the 
      surface under the cumulative ranking curve values. Statistical analysis will ensue 
      using Stata software (v16). The statistical significance estimation will happen at 
      p<0.05 and 95% confidence interval. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO registration no: 
      CRD42021271199; https://clinicaltrials.gov/.

TI  - Temporal trends in the physical fitness of Hong Kong adolescents between 1998 and 
      2015.
LID - 10.1055/a-1738-2072 [doi]
AB  - Low physical fitness in adolescence is linked with increased cardiometabolic risk 
      and early all-cause mortality. This study aimed to estimate temporal trends in the 
      physical fitness of Hong Kong adolescents aged 12-17 years between 1998 and 2015. 
      Physical fitness (9-min run/walk, sit-ups, push-ups, and sit-and-reach) and body 
      size data in a total of 28,059 adolescents tested across five 
      population-representative surveys of Hong Kong secondary school pupils, were 
      reported. Temporal trends in means were estimated at the gender-age level by 
      best-fitting sample-weighted linear regression, with national trends estimated by a 
      post-stratified population-weighting procedure. Overall, there were small declines 
      in 9-min run/walk (effect size (ES) = 0.29 (95%CI: 0.32, 0.26)) and sit-ups 
      performance (ES = 0.24 (95%CI: 0.27, 0.21)), with negligible changes in push-ups 
      and sit-and-reach performance. There were small concurrent increases in both mean 
      height and body mass, with a negligible increase in sum of skinfolds. Trends in mean 
      physical fitness and body size/ were not always uniform across the population 
      distribution. The small declines in mean 9-min run/walk and sit-ups performance for 
      Hong Kong adolescents are suggestive of corresponding declines in cardiorespiratory 
      fitness and abdominal/core endurance, respectively. Increased national health 
      promotion strategies are required to improve existing fitness trends.

      from substance misuse.

AB  - Substance use disorders (SUDs) and obesity are both chronic, relapsing, remitting 
      disorders that arise from a heightened preference for immediate-focused rewards 
      (i.e., steep temporal discounting). During recovery from SUDs, overweight and obese 
      outcomes are common as individuals may replace drug rewards for food rewards. 
      However, little has been done to investigate the neuropsychological processes 
      underlying food reward and addiction in individuals recovering from SUDs. Using data 
      collected from the International Quit and Recovery Registry and Amazon Mechanical 
      Turk, we aimed to elucidate the factors that influence the attraction to palatable 
      foods in a population in recovery from substance misuse (n = 114) as well as a 
      population with no history of substance misuse (n = 97). We hypothesized that 
      individuals in recovery from substance misuse would have steeper temporal 
      discounting, an increased drive for palatable foods (i.e., hedonic hunger), and 
      greater food addiction symptoms than non-substance users. Contrary to our 
      hypotheses, we found that individuals in recovery from SUDs show improved outcomes 
      in temporal discounting, hedonic hunger, and food addiction symptoms. Moreover, 
      recovery status and temporal discounting significantly predicted these outcomes. Our 
      findings suggest that the enhanced executive control processes needed for successful 
      SUD recovery may transfer to other reward-related processes such as food reward and 
      consumption. Interventions targeted at improving executive function including 
      episodic future thinking, meditation, or exercise, may be excellent ways to support 
      a successful recovery and improve other reward-related processes, including food 
      consumption, to decrease the risk of overweight or obese outcomes during recovery.

TI  - Development of metabolic and contractile alterations in development of cancer 
      cachexia in female tumor-bearing mice.

AB  - Cancer cachexia (CC) results in impaired muscle function and quality of life and is 
      the primary cause of death for ∼20%-30% of patients with cancer. We demonstrated 
      mitochondrial degeneration as a precursor to CC in male mice; however, whether such 
      alterations occur in females is currently unknown. The purpose of this study was to 
      elucidate muscle alterations in CC development in female tumor-bearing mice. Sixty 
      female C57BL/6J mice were injected with PBS or Lewis lung carcinoma at 8 wk of age, 
      and tumors developed for 1, 2, 3, or 4 wk to assess the time course of cachectic 
      development. In vivo muscle contractile function, protein fractional synthetic rate 
      (FSR), protein turnover, and mitochondrial health were assessed. Three- and 
      four-week tumor-bearing mice displayed a dichotomy in tumor growth and were 
      reassigned to high tumor (HT) and low tumor (LT) groups. HT mice exhibited lower 
      soleus, tibialis anterior, and fat weights than PBS mice. HT mice showed lower peak 
      isometric torque and slower one-half relaxation time than PBS mice. HT mice had 
      lower FSR than PBS mice, whereas E3 ubiquitin ligases were greater in HT than in 
      other groups. Bnip3 (mitophagy) and pMitoTimer red puncta (mitochondrial 
      degeneration) were greater in HT mice, whereas Pgc1α1 and Tfam (mitochondrial 
      biogenesis) were lower in HT mice than in PBS mice. We demonstrate alterations in 
      female tumor-bearing mice where HT exhibited greater protein degradation, impaired 
      muscle contractility, and mitochondrial degeneration compared with other groups. Our 
      data provide novel evidence for a distinct cachectic development in tumor-bearing 
      female mice compared with previous male studies.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our study 
      demonstrates divergent tumor development and tissue wasting within 3- and 4-wk mice, 
      where approximately half the mice developed large tumors and subsequent cachexia. 
      Unlike previous male studies, where metabolic perturbations precede the onset of 
      cachexia, females appear to exhibit protections from the metabolic perturbations and 
      cachexia development. Our data provide novel evidence for divergent cachectic 
      development in tumor-bearing female mice compared with previous male CC studies, 
      suggesting different mechanisms of CC between sexes.

AB  - Food flavors are volatile compounds that impact the human sensory perception 
      profoundly and find extensive applications in various food products. Because of 
      their volatility and high sensitivity to pH, temperature, oxidation, and external 
      conditions, they require adequate protection to last for a longer duration. 
      Encapsulation plays a critical role in preserving food flavors by enhancing their 
      thermal and oxidative stability, overcoming volatility limitations, and regulating 
      their rapid release with improved bioavailability in food products. The current 
      review focuses on the recent developments in food flavor encapsulation techniques, 
      such as electrospinning/spraying, cyclodextrin inclusion complexes, coacervation, 
      and yeast cell micro-carriers. The review also comprehensively discusses the role of 
      encapsulants in achieving controlled flavor release, the mechanisms involved, and 
      the mathematical modelling for flavor release. Specific well-established 
      nanoencapsulation techniques render better encapsulation efficiency and controlled 
      release of flavor compounds. The review examined specific emerging methods for 
      flavor encapsulation, such as yeast cell encapsulation, which require further 
      exploration and development. This article provides readers with up-to-date 
      information on different encapsulation processes and coating methods used for flavor 
      encapsulation.

TI  - Measurement bias in estimates of system power during a vertical jump.
PG  - 226-238
LID - 10.1080/14763141.2019.1649715 [doi]
AB  - This investigation sought to quantify the level of measurement agreement in system 
      force, velocity and power values derived across three commonly applied assessment 
      techniques during a countermovement jump (CMJ). Twenty-five male national 
      representative athletes completed three CMJs under unloaded (0%(1RM)) and loaded 
      (40%(1RM)) jump conditions. Associated values of force, velocity and power were 
      captured simultaneously from either a linear optical encoder (LOE) or force plate 
      (FP) and then compared to the gold-standard reference values derived from a combined 
      force plate and three-dimensional motion capture system (FPMC). The LOE 
      significantly (p < 0.001) overestimated and failed to meet the minimum level of 
      relatedness (<0.80) for measures of peak velocity, peak force, peak power and mean 
      power across both conditions compared to the FPMC reference values. A reduction in 
      measurement dispersion and bias was, however, evident during the loaded condition. 
      The FP significantly (p < 0.05) underestimated mean and peak power across both 
      conditions, yet measurement bias and dispersion remained consistent. These findings 
      highlight a disparity in measurement agreement in force, velocity and power values 
      across alternative assessment techniques and loads. Such variance in measurement 
      agreement will uniquely alter derived force-velocity profiles, and thus the 
      prescription of training loads to maximise system power during unrestricted CMJs.

TI  - Hypohydration but not Menstrual Phase Influences Pain Perception in Healthy Women.
LID - 10.1152/japplphysiol.00402.2021 [doi]
AB  - Chronic pain is a pervasive health problem and is associated with tremendous 
      socioeconomic costs. However, current pain treatments are often ineffective due, in 
      part, to the multi-factorial nature of pain. Mild hypohydration was shown to 
      increase experimental pain sensitivity in men, but whether this also occurs in women 
      has not been examined. Fluctuations in ovarian hormones (i.e., 17ß-oestradiol and 
      progesterone) throughout the menstrual cycle may influence a woman's pain 
      sensitivity, as well as hydration levels, suggesting possible interactions between 
      hypohydration and menstrual phase on pain. We investigated the effects of mild 
      hypohydration (HYPO, 24 hr of fluid restriction) on ischaemic pain sensitivity in 14 
      eumenorrheic women during the early follicular (EF) and mid-luteal (ML) phases of 
      their menstrual cycle. We also examined whether acute water ingestion could reverse 
      the negative effects of hypohydration. Elevated serum osmolality, plasma copeptin, 
      and urine specific gravity indicated mild hypohydration. Compared to euhydration, 
      HYPO reduced pain tolerance (by 34 ± 46 s; P = 0.02, ηp(2) = 0.37) and increased 
      ratings of pain intensity (by 0.7 ± 0.7 cm; P = 0.004; ηp(2) = 0.55) and 
      unpleasantness (by 0.7 ± 0.9 cm; P = 0.02; ηp(2) = 0.40); these results were not 
      influenced by menstrual phase. Water ingestion reduced thirst perception (Visual 
      Analogue Scale, by 2.3 ± 0.9 cm; P < 0.001, ηp(2) = 0.88) but did not reduce pain 
      sensitivity. Therefore, hypohydration increases pain sensitivity in women with no 
      influence of menstrual phase.

AB  - Depression is estimated to be the second leading cause of disability in the United 
      States and is associated with a 52% increased risk of death. Lifestyle components 
      may have an important role in depression pathogenesis. The aims of this study were 
      to analyze the association of meeting the physical activity (PA) recommendation 
      guidelines and depression, and to analyze the all-cause mortality risk of the joint 
      association of PA and depression. This cross-sectional study included 7201 
      participants from the 2007-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
      aged ≥ 50 years and linked to National Death Index records through December 31, 
      2015. Depression was defined as a score ≥ 10 using the Patient Health Questionnaire 
      (PHQ-9). PA was self-reported, and total PA was used to classify participants as 
      more active (≥ 600 MET-min/week) or less active (< 600 MET-min/week). The odds 
      ratios for depression were examined according to be more active or less active. The 
      hazard ratios (HR) for the association of PA level and depression status with 
      all-cause mortality were examined. Being more active was associated with reduced 
      odds for depression. Compared with less active participants with depression, those 
      who were more active and having depression had HR 0.45 (95% CI 0.22, 0.91, 
      p = 0.026) for all-cause mortality. Being more active is associated with lower odds 
      for depression and seems to be a protective factor against the increased all-cause 
      mortality risk due to depression.

      Drivers: A Cross-Sectional Analysis.
LID - 10.1097/JOM.0000000000002484 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Physical inactivity, prolonged sitting, and unhealthy dietary habits are 
      common in Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) drivers. These factors increase risk of 
      long-term health conditions. METHODS: 329 HGV drivers across 25 UK depots completed 
      a health assessment, including questionnaire completion, and objectively measured 
      anthropometrics, blood biomarkers, physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviour. 
      RESULTS: The sample demonstrated a high-risk cardiometabolic health profile. 88.1% 
      were overweight or had obesity, 11.9% had pre-diabetes or diabetes. 28.3% had 
      hypertension, 83.6% had clinically elevated circulating LDL-cholesterol 
      concentrations (>2mmol/l), and 66.6% had high total cholesterol levels (>4 mmol/l). 
      On workdays drivers accumulated 12 hrs/day of sitting, 1.7 hrs/day of light PA (LPA) 
      and 9.8 mins/day of moderate-to-vigorous PA. Associations between LPA and 
      cardiometabolic markers were observed. CONCLUSION: This sample presents high levels 
      of inactivity, overweight and obesity, and unhealthy cardiometabolic health 
      profiles.

TI  - Physical and mental health profile of patients with the early-onset severe COPD 
      phenotype: A cross-sectional analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIM: Patients with early-onset severe COPD are often female and 
      characterized by severe emphysema. Extrapulmonary disease manifestations have not 
      yet been investigated in this clinical phenotype. Therefore, this study aimed to 
      study the physical and mental health profile of patients with early-onset severe 
      COPD. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis including 1058 patients with COPD 
      who were referred for pulmonary rehabilitation between July 2013 and August 2018. 
      Based on a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) <50%predicted and age <55 years, 
      78 patients were identified having early-onset severe COPD. Using propensity score 
      matching, these patients were matched to 54 early-onset mild-to-moderate, 158 older 
      severe and 103 older mild-to-moderate COPD patients based on FEV(1)%predicted, age 
      and gender. An extensive panel of pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease markers (i.e. 
      body composition, physical performance and mental health) was compared between these 
      groups. RESULTS: Pulmonary manifestations as well as physical and mental health were 
      similar in patients with early-onset severe COPD compared to older severe patients, 
      despite a mean age difference of 15.8 years. Remarkably, a high prevalence of 
      depression was observed in early-onset severe COPD which was significantly higher 
      compared to older severe patients (51.9 vs 32.7%, p = 0.029). In line with a large 
      difference in FEV(1) (33.9 (25.1-41.5) vs 71.8 (61.3-85.4), p < 0.001), patients 
      with early-onset severe COPD had lower exercise performance, indicated by a lower 
      6-min walking distance and peak work rate (mean difference 71.1 m, p = 0.001, and 
      25.9%predicted, p < 0.001, respectively), compared to patients with early-onset 
      mild-to-moderate COPD. Interestingly, body composition and isokinetic muscle 
      strength were not different between these comparable age groups. CONCLUSION: 
      Pulmonary and physical health limitations are generally comparable between younger 
      and older patients with severe airflow limitation, while more younger patients might 
      have mental problems. These data suggest the need for early identification of 
      subjects at risk for early-onset severe COPD.

AB  - This study examined the influence of 7 high school esports developmental programs on 
      student self-regulation, growth mindset, positive youth development (PYD), perceived 
      general health and physical activity (PA), and sport behaviour. A total of 188 
      students (male n = 120; female n = 68) originally participated (89 enrolled in an 
      esports program in their school and 99 acted as aged-matched controls), with 58 
      participants (n = 19 esports group; n = 39 controls) completing both pre- and 
      post-program information. At baseline, no significant differences were found between 
      youth e-athletes and their aged-matched controls. The analysis for the observation 
      period showed a significant interaction effect for the PYD confidence scale, with 
      post-hoc comparisons showing a significant decrease in the control group from pre- 
      to post assessment whereas the esports group remained the same. Time main effects 
      showed a decrease in the self-regulation motivation factor, PYD connection factor 
      and PA for all participants. Overall, this study showed that students enrolled in 
      their respective school esports program did not differ from those who did not in 
      self-regulation, growth mindset, PYD, perceived health and PA, and sport behaviour. 
      It was likely that all participants showed a decrease in motivation, connection, and 
      PA due to COVID19 lockdown during the study period. This study is the first to 
      investigate the longitudinal impact of student involvement in high school esports 
      and showed that esports participation did not have a negative impact on any health 
      or psychological factors.

AB  - The current epidemics of cardiovascular and metabolic noncommunicable diseases have 
      emerged alongside dramatic modifications in lifestyle and living environments. These 
      correspond to changes in our "modern" postwar societies globally characterized by 
      rural-to-urban migration, modernization of agricultural practices, and 
      transportation, climate change, and aging. Evidence suggests that these changes are 
      related to each other, although the social and biological mechanisms as well as 
      their interactions have yet to be uncovered. LongITools, as one of the 9 projects 
      included in the European Human Exposome Network, will tackle this environmental 
      health equation linking multidimensional environmental exposures to the occurrence 
      of cardiovascular and metabolic noncommunicable diseases.

      of Covid-19.

AB  - Skeletal muscle-related symptoms are common in both acute coronavirus disease 
      (Covid)-19 and post-acute sequelae of Covid-19 (PASC). In this narrative review, we 
      discuss cellular and molecular pathways that are affected and consider these in 
      regard to skeletal muscle involvement in other conditions, such as acute respiratory 
      distress syndrome, critical illness myopathy, and post-viral fatigue syndrome. 
      Patients with severe Covid-19 and PASC suffer from skeletal muscle weakness and 
      exercise intolerance. Histological sections present muscle fibre atrophy, metabolic 
      alterations, and immune cell infiltration. Contributing factors to weakness and 
      fatigue in patients with severe Covid-19 include systemic inflammation, disuse, 
      hypoxaemia, and malnutrition. These factors also contribute to post-intensive care 
      unit (ICU) syndrome and ICU-acquired weakness and likely explain a substantial part 
      of Covid-19-acquired weakness. The skeletal muscle weakness and exercise intolerance 
      associated with PASC are more obscure. Direct severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 viral infiltration into skeletal muscle or an aberrant 
      immune system likely contribute. Similarities between skeletal muscle alterations in 
      PASC and chronic fatigue syndrome deserve further study. Both SARS-CoV-2-specific 
      factors and generic consequences of acute disease likely underlie the observed 
      skeletal muscle alterations in both acute Covid-19 and PASC.

TI  - Impact of risk of generalizability biases in adult obesity interventions: A 
      meta-epidemiological review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e13369
LID - 10.1111/obr.13369 [doi]
AB  - Biases introduced in early-stage studies can lead to inflated early discoveries. The 
      risk of generalizability biases (RGBs) identifies key features of feasibility 
      studies that, when present, lead to reduced impact in a larger trial. This 
      meta-study examined the influence of RGBs in adult obesity interventions. Behavioral 
      interventions with a published feasibility study and a larger scale trial of the 
      same intervention (e.g., pairs) were identified. Each pair was coded for the 
      presence of RGBs. Quantitative outcomes were extracted. Multilevel meta-regression 
      models were used to examine the impact of RGBs on the difference in the effect size 
      (ES, standardized mean difference) from pilot to larger scale trial. A total of 114 
      pairs, representing 230 studies, were identified. Overall, 75% of the pairs had at 
      least one RGB present. The four most prevalent RGBs were duration (33%), delivery 
      agent (30%), implementation support (23%), and target audience (22%) bias. The 
      largest reductions in the ES were observed in pairs where an RGB was present in the 
      pilot and removed in the larger scale trial (average reduction ES -0.41, range -1.06 
      to 0.01), compared with pairs without an RGB (average reduction ES -0.15, range 
      -0.18 to -0.14). Eliminating RGBs during early-stage testing may result in improved 
      evidence.

TI  - Non-thermal pretreatment affects Ginkgo biloba L. seed's product qualities, sensory, 
      and physicochemical properties.

AB  - Drying plays a significant role in Ginkgo biloba seed's (GBS) processing, and the 
      previous research showed drying affected the product quality. A combined hurdle 
      drying technology (integrated non-thermal pretreatment and drying) could be applied 
      on GBS to achieve better product quality. Osmotic (OS), osmo-vacuum (OS + V), 
      sonication (US), and osmosonication (OS + US) pretreatment followed by infrared 
      drying was performed on GBS, and the product qualities (texture, color, enzyme 
      inactivation, water activity, and microstructure), physicochemical properties 
      (titrable acidity, reducing sugar, soluble solids, total sugar, free amino acid, and 
      ascorbic acid), and organoleptic qualities were evaluated. Results showed 
      pretreatment had various effects on physicochemical and product quality, and was 
      confirmed by principal component analysis (PCA). The sensory scores, acceptability 
      index combined with Pearson's correlation, and PCA showed that different 
      pretreatments influenced the likeness and acceptability, and color, taste, and odor 
      were the key determinants and strongly associated with the consumers' preferences. 
      The untreated GBS (no pretreatment before drying) had a higher color change and 
      lower enzyme inactivation. Pretreatment increased texture preservation after thermal 
      processing, although it had a negative effect on soluble solids, reducing sugar and 
      total sugar content. While the US improved the texture, it resulted in shrinkage 
      (from the microstructure) and total sugar degradation. Among the various hurdle 
      technologies, osmosonication (OS + US, followed by infrared drying) had the highest 
      sensory attributes, free amino acid, slight structure deformation, and lowest water 
      activity. The present study showed that osmosonication is a promising hurdle 
      technology for GBS because it provides better quality attributes. PRACTICAL 
      APPLICATION: Previous research showed that Ginkgo biloba seed (GBS) drying has an 
      impact on product quality, which will ultimately determine GBS acceptance. This 
      research was set out to envisage and advance current dryer design by merging the 
      sequential operations (integrated non-thermal pretreatment and drying), also known 
      as hurdle drying technology on GBS, to achieve better process efficiency, product 
      quality, and make GBS's drying process more sustainable. The various pretreatments 
      improved ginkgo seed's product qualities compared to the control (no pretreatment 
      prior to drying). Osmosonication is a promising hurdle technology for GBS 
      processing.

TI  - Quantifying the overall impact of an early childhood multi-behavioural lifestyle 
      intervention.
PG  - e12861
LID - 10.1111/ijpo.12861 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The overall impact of interventions targeting multiple behaviours 
      remains largely unexplored. OBJECTIVES: This study adopted an integrative lifestyle 
      pattern analysis approach to assess the overall effectiveness of an early childhood 
      intervention on change across multiple behaviours. METHODS: The Melbourne INFANT 
      program was a 15-month cluster-randomized controlled trial involving 4-month-old 
      infants and their parents at baseline in 2008 (n = 542). The intervention included 
      six education sessions helping parents to promote a healthy diet, physical activity 
      and limit sedentary behaviour in their infants. Participants were followed-up twice 
      post-intervention, at ages 3.6 (2011) and 5 years (2013), to assess sustained 
      effects of the intervention. Previous principal component analyses identified two 
      lifestyle patterns from dietary intake, outdoor time and television viewing time. 
      Random effect linear regression models were conducted to assess the impact of the 
      intervention on lifestyle patterns. RESULTS: The intervention group had a lower 
      'Discretionary consumption and TV' lifestyle pattern score than the control group at 
      all time points with adjusted mean difference: -0.29, 95% CI -0.49, -0.09, p = 0.004 
      post-intervention at age 1.5 years; -0.29, 95% CI -0.54, -0.04, p = 0.02 at the 
      first follow-up (age 3.6 years); and -0.21, 95% CI -0.43, 0.01, p = 0.06 at the 
      second follow-up (age 5.0 years). No evidence of between-group differences was found 
      for the 'Fruit, vegetables and outdoor' lifestyle pattern score. CONCLUSION: This 
      early childhood intervention designed to promote change in more than one 
      obesity-related behaviour was effective in improving correlated unhealthy lifestyle 
      behaviours. Lifestyle pattern analysis is a useful and interpretable approach for 
      evaluating multi-behavioural interventions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Out of school hours care (OSHC) is a fast-growing childcare setting in 
      Australia, however the types of foods and beverages offered are relatively unknown. 
      This study describes the food and beverages offered and investigates sector-level 
      and setting-level factors which may impact OSHC in meeting the Australian Dietary 
      Guidelines (ADG). METHODS: This cross-sectional, observational study was conducted 
      in 89 OSHC services (between 2018 and 2019). Food and beverages offered, kitchen 
      facilities and menus were captured via direct observation. Foods were categorised 
      into five food groups or discretionary foods, based on the ADG, and frequencies 
      determined. Short interviews with OSHC directors ascertained healthy eating 
      policies, staff training, food quality assessment methods and food budgets. Fisher's 
      exact test explored the influence of sector-level and setting-level factors on food 
      provision behaviours. RESULTS: Discretionary foods (1.5 ± 0.68) were offered more 
      frequently than vegetables (0.82 ± 0.80) (p < .001), dairy (0.97 ± 0.81) (p = .013) 
      and lean meats (0.22 ± 0.54) (p < .001). OSHC associated with long day care and 
      reported using valid food quality assessment methods offered more lean meats (p= 
      .002, and p= .004). Larger organisations offered more vegetables (p = .015) and 
      discretionary foods (p= .007). Menus with clearly worded instructions to provide 
      fruits and vegetables daily offered more fruit (p= .009), vegetables (p < .001) and 
      whole grains (p= .003). No other sector or setting-level factors were associated 
      with services aligning with the ADG. CONCLUSION: Future interventions could benefit 
      from trialling menu planning training and tools to assist OSHC services in NSW meet 
      the ADG requirements.

AB  - Dietary patterns examine the combinations, types and quantities of foods consumed in 
      the diet. Compared to individual nutrients, dietary patterns may be better 
      associated with cancer-related malnutrition, low muscle mass and sarcopenia. This 
      scoping review identified associations between dietary patterns, assessed using 
      data-driven methods (i.e., statistical methods used to derive existing dietary 
      patterns) and hypothesis-orientated methods (i.e., adherence to diet quality 
      indices), and malnutrition, low muscle (lean) mass and sarcopenia. MEDLINE, Embase 
      and CINAHL databases were searched up to September 2021. Of the 3341 studies 
      identified, seven studies were eligible for review. Study designs included 
      experimental (n = 5) and observational (n = 2), and people with prostate, ovarian 
      and endometrial, bladder, breast, and gastrointestinal cancers. One study used 
      data-driven methods to derive dietary patterns, finding adherence to a 'fat and 
      fish' diet was associated with lower odds of low muscle mass. Two studies examined 
      adherence to hypothesis-orientated methods including the Mediterranean Diet 
      Adherence Screener and Healthy Eating Index 2010 and four studies used 
      'non-traditional' approaches to analyse dietary patterns. Hypothesis-orientated 
      dietary patterns, developed to improve general health and prevent chronic disease, 
      and 'non-traditional' dietary patterns demonstrated inconsistent effects on muscle 
      (lean) mass. All studies investigated muscle (lean) mass, omitting malnutrition and 
      sarcopenia as cancer-related outcomes. This scoping review highlights the limited 
      research examining the effect of dietary patterns on cancer-related outcomes.

TI  - Blood-derived miRNA levels are not correlated with metabolic or anthropometric 
      parameters in obese pre-diabetic subjects but with systemic inflammation.

AB  - As blood-derived miRNAs (c-miRNAs) are modulated by exercise and nutrition, we 
      postulated that they might be used to monitor the effects of a lifestyle 
      intervention (LI) to prevent diabetes development. To challenge this hypothesis, 
      obese Asian Indian pre-diabetic patients were submitted to diet modifications and 
      physical activity for 4 months (LI group) and compared to a control group which was 
      given recommendations only. We have considered 2 periods of time to analyze the 
      data, i.e.; a first one to study the response to the intervention (4 months), and a 
      second one post-intervention (8 months). At basal, 4 months and 8 months 
      post-intervention the levels of 17 c-miRNAs were quantified, selected either for 
      their relevance to the pathology or because they are known to be modulated by 
      physical activity or diet. Their variations were correlated with variations of 25 
      metabolic and anthropometric parameters and cytokines. As expected, 
      fasting-glycaemia, insulin-sensitivity, levels of exercise- and obesity-induced 
      cytokines were ameliorated after 4 months. In addition, the levels of 4 miRNAs 
      (i.e.; miR-128-3p, miR-374a-5p, miR-221-3p, and miR-133a-3p) were changed only in 
      the LI group and were correlated with metabolic improvement (insulin sensitivity, 
      cytokine levels, waist circumference and systolic blood pressure). However, 8 months 
      post-intervention almost all ameliorated metabolic parameters declined indicating 
      that the volunteers did not continue the protocol on their own. Surprisingly, the LI 
      positive effects on c-miRNA levels were still detected, and were even more 
      pronounced 8 months post-intervention. In parallel, MCP-1, involved in tissue 
      infiltration by immune cells, and Il-6, adiponectin and irisin, which have 
      anti-inflammatory effects, continued to be significantly and positively modified, 8 
      months post-intervention. These data demonstrated for the first time, that c-miRNA 
      correlations with metabolic parameters and insulin sensitivity are in fact only 
      indirect and likely associated with the level systemic inflammation. More generally 
      speaking, this important result explains the high variability between the previous 
      studies designed to identify specific c-miRNAs associated with the severity of 
      insulin-resistance. The results of all these studies should take into account the 
      level of inflammation of the patients. In addition, this finding could also explain 
      why, whatever the pathology considered (i.e.; cancers, diabetes, neurodegenerative 
      disorders, inflammatory diseases) the same subset of miRNAs is always found altered 
      in the blood of patients vs healthy subjects, as these pathologies are all 
      associated with the development of inflammation.

TI  - A matter of frailty: the modified Subdural Hematoma in the Elderly (mSHE) score.
PG  - 701-708
LID - 10.1007/s10143-021-01586-2 [doi]
AB  - The Subdural Hematoma in the Elderly (SHE) score was developed as a model to predict 
      30-day mortality from acute, chronic, and mixed subdural hematoma in the elderly 
      population after minor or no trauma. Emerging evidence suggests frailty to be 
      predictive of mortality and morbidity in the elderly. In this study, we aim to 
      externally validate the SHE for chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) alone, and we 
      hypothesize that the incorporation of frailty into the SHE may increase its 
      predictive power. A retrospective cohort of elderly patients with CSDH after minor 
      or no trauma being treated at our institution was evaluated with the SHE. Thirty-day 
      mortality and outcome were documented. Patients were assessed with the Clinical 
      Frailty Scale (CFS), which was incorporated into a modified SHE (mSHE). Both the SHE 
      and the mSHE were then assessed in their predictive powers through receiver 
      operating characteristic statistics. We included 168 patients. Most (n = 124, 74%) 
      had a favorable outcome at 30 days. Mortality was low at n = 7, 4%. The SHE failed 
      to predict mortality (AUC = .564, p = .565). Contrarily, the mSHE performed well in 
      both mortality (AUC = .749, p = .026) and outcome (AUC = .862, p < .001). A 
      threshold of mSHE = 3 is predictive of mortality with a sensitivity of 50% and a 
      specificity of 75% and of poor outcome with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity 
      of 64%. Frailty should be routinely evaluated in elderly individuals, as it can 
      predict outcome and mortality, providing the possibility for medical, surgical, 
      nutritional, cognitive, and physical exercise interventions.

AB  - This study examined the associations between the frequency of low scores on the 
      Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Test (ImPACT) by race and 
      socioeconomic status (SES), using the proxy of Title I school status, among 
      adolescent student-athletes and calculated multivariate base rates. There were 753 
      participants assigned to groups based on race (White: n = 430, 59.8%; Black: n 
      = 289, 40.2%) and SES. Black student-athletes obtained more low neurocognitive test 
      scores, which was associated with lower SES. The current study offers a resource to 
      clinicians involved in concussion management who may wish to consider race and SES 
      when interpreting ImPACT test performances.

TI  - Some Insect Species are Good Quality Protein Sources for Children and Adults: 
      Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS) Determined in Growing Pigs.
LID - nxac019 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jn/nxac019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insect species are suitable for farming as 'mini livestock' for human 
      and animal consumption. It is important to assess the protein quality of relevant 
      species to understand the potential of these novel protein sources in future 
      sustainable food systems. OBJECTIVES: To determine the protein quality of five 
      insect species: lesser mealworm (LMW), yellow mealworm (YMW), house cricket (HC), 
      banded cricket (BC) and black soldier fly (BSF) using the digestible indispensable 
      amino acid score (DIAAS) in a pig model. DESIGN: Five diets were formulated to 
      contain 10% insect crude protein (CP). A nitrogen (N)-free diet was included to 
      estimate endogenous losses. In a 6 × 6 Latin square design, 6 ileal cannulated 
      crossbred (Duroc × [Danish Landrace × Yorkshire]) male pigs with an initial body 
      weight of 35 ± 2 kg were fed the 6 diets. Each diet was fed for 1 wk over 6 wk. 
      Ileal digesta was collected for 8 h on days 5 and 7 each wk. Analyzed CP, amino acid 
      (AA) contents and calculated values of standardized ileal digestibility (SID) for CP 
      and AAs of each insect were used to assess the DIAAS. RESULTS: The DIAAS for young 
      children aged 6 mo to 3 y and for older children, adolescents and adults identified 
      Sulphur AAs (SAAs, cysteine + methionine) as the first limiting AA in all four 
      species of cricket and mealworm. For young children, both cricket species had DIAAS 
      above 75 and for older children, adolescents and adults both cricket species and LMW 
      had DIAAS above 75. CONCLUSIONS: Both cricket species (HC and BC) are classified as 
      good quality protein sources for young children aged 6 mo to 3 y and for older 
      children, adolescents and adults. One mealworm species, LMW, is a good quality 
      protein source for older children, adolescents and adults.

LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e08853 [doi]
LID - e08853
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression after myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with poor 
      prognosis. This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram to predict the risk 
      of depression in patients with MI. METHODS: This retrospective study included 1615 
      survivors of MI aged >20 years who were selected from the 2005-2018 National Health 
      and Nutrition Examination Survey database. The 899 subjects from the 2005-2012 
      survey comprised the development group, and the remaining 716 subjects comprised the 
      validation group. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified variables 
      significantly associated with depression. The least absolute shrinkage and selection 
      operator (LASSO) binomial regression model was used to select the best predictive 
      variables. RESULTS: A full predictive model and a simplified model were developed 
      using multivariate analysis and LASSO binomial regression results, respectively, and 
      validated using data from the validation group. The receiver operator characteristic 
      curve and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test were used to assess the nomogram's 
      performance. The full nomogram model included 8 items: age, BMI, smoking, drinking, 
      diabetes, exercise, insomnia, and PIR. The area under the curve for the development 
      group was 0.799 and for the validation group was 0.731, indicating that our model 
      has good stability and predictive accuracy. The goodness of fit test showed a good 
      model calibration for both groups. The simplified model includes age, smoking, PIR, 
      and insomnia. The AUC of the simplified model was 0.772 and 0.711 in the development 
      and validation groups, respectively, indicating that the simplified model still 
      possessed good predictive accuracy. CONCLUSION: Our nomogram helped assess the 
      individual probability of depression after MI and can be used as a complement to

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) is described as a plant-based dietary 
      pattern with adherence associated with reductions in chronic disease risk and 
      longevity. Although the nutrient profile is diverse and complex, the MedDiet is 
      often described as a rich source of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) derived 
      from fish, seafood and nuts. However, whether MedDiet adherence results in 
      appreciable increases in tissue levels of n-3 PUFAs is yet to be systematically 
      investigated. This systematic review synthesized the literature to determine the 
      impact of the MedDiet on n-3 PUFA tissue levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline, 
      Embase, Amed, and CINAHL databases were searched for studies reporting on adherence 
      to a MedDiet and tissue levels of n-3 PUFAs. PROSPERO registration number is CRD 
      42020162114. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included. Seven were observational 
      studies and 15 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). All observational studies 
      reported a positive relationship between adherence and higher tissue n-3 PUFA 
      levels. Two-thirds (10/15) of RCTs reported significant increases in n-3 PUFA 
      concentrations. DISCUSSION: MedDiet adherence is associated with higher tissue 
      levels of n-3 PUFA. However, we report heterogeneity in the description across all 
      MedDiet interventions.

TI  - Consumer acceptability of plant-, seaweed-, and insect-based foods as alternatives 
      to meat: a critical compilation of a decade of research.
PG  - 1-22
LID - 10.1080/10408398.2022.2036096 [doi]
AB  - There is a growing criticism of meat-based products over environment, animal 
      welfare, and public health. Meat lovers are keeping and adapting their habits, while 
      other consumers are increasingly shifting toward meat alternatives considered as 
      healthier and more sustainable options to replace the animal-based products. This 
      transition gives room in the market to plant-, seaweed-, and insect-based meat 
      products alternatives. Nevertheless, these emerging markets are still facing the 
      challenge of consumers' acceptance and the uncertainty in terms of preferences. This 
      paper focuses on in-depth understanding of consumer perception and acceptability of 
      plant-, seaweed-, and insect-based meat products to get insights on their current 
      situation and future implementation. The main factors and motives influencing the 
      consumer perceptions toward meat alternative products are reported. Further, the 
      consumers' motives and drivers to consume alternative products were highlighted. 
      This review, provides a better understanding of motives and drivers of consumers' 
      acceptance to improve the acceptability of meat alternatives, considering product 
      and country origin of the consumers of meat alternative foods.Supplemental data for

TI  - Comparative N-glycoproteomic analysis of Tibetan and lowland chicken fertilized 
      eggs: Implications on proteins biofunction and species evolution.
PG  - e14006
LID - 10.1111/jfbc.14006 [doi]
AB  - The characterization and functionality of protein glycosylation among different 
      related species are of common interest. Herein, non-standard quantification and 
      N-glycosylation enrichment technology combined with ultra-high liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were used to establish detailed 
      N-glycoproteomics of fertilized eggs, and quantitatively compared between Tibetan 
      and lowland chicken. A total of 396N-glycosites from 143 glycoproteins were found. 
      Specifically, compared with lowland chicken egg white, 32N-glycosites of 22 
      glycoproteins were up-regulated and 57N-glycosites of 25 glycoproteins were 
      down-regulated in Tibetan chicken egg white. Also, 137N-glycosites in 72 
      glycoproteins showed much higher-degree glycosylation and 36N-glycosites in 15 
      glycoproteins displayed lower-degree glycosylation in Tibetan chicken egg yolk than 
      those in lowland chicken egg yolk. Through bioinformatic analysis, these varied 
      glycoproteins were highly associated with antifreeze activity, hypoxia adaptation, 
      coagulation cascade, and binding/immunity activities, which may be related to 
      plateau hypoxia and cold stress. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: These findings provide a 
      new insight on the role of biological egg N-glycoproteins related to environmental 
      adaptation and evolution, which may be further applied in improving egg processing 
      and human health, by developing biomolecules for food and medical industry.

TI  - Staff perspectives on the feeding practices used in holiday clubs to promote healthy 
      eating in disadvantaged communities.
LID - 10.1111/hsc.13757 [doi]
AB  - An increasing number of holiday clubs provide free meals to alleviate children's 
      hunger during the school holidays. Holiday clubs are well-placed to promote healthy 
      eating among children from disadvantaged communities who may be at risk of 
      experiencing food insecurity, but currently little is known about the feeding 
      practices used by staff and whether these are conducive to maximising opportunities 
      to promote healthy eating. Unlike previous research which has predominantly studied 
      feeding practices in parent-child dyads and childcare settings, this qualitative 
      study explored staff perspectives on the feeding practices they use to promote 
      healthy eating within nine UK holiday clubs working with children from disadvantaged 
      communities. Nine individual interviews and four focus groups were completed with 27 
      holiday club staff during the 2019 summer holidays. Thematic analysis revealed seven 
      feeding practice themes, including teaching about nutrition; encouraging balance and 
      variety; modelling; involvement; non-food rewards; restriction; and reoffering 
      foods. The results revealed that some staff implement various positive feeding 
      practices which align with the existing evidence-base of feeding practices in other 
      contexts, which is a promising finding given the current lack of information and 
      guidance from which to draw on. However, staff also sometimes reported using 
      maladaptive feeding practices, including overt restriction and punishment. These 
      results emphasise the need for guidance on effective ways to implement feeding 
      practices with children in holiday clubs. Indeed, staff demonstrated their 
      receptivity to engaging with training resources to maximise their opportunities to 
      promote healthy eating behaviours among children.

LID - S1466-853X(21)00187-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ptsp.2021.11.004 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review with meta-analyses was to determine the 
      dynamic reach differences 1) between chronic ankle instability (CAI) and uninjured 
      individuals, 2) between the limbs of an individual with CAI, and 3) between the 
      uninvolved CAI limb and the healthy control limb across all possible reach 
      directions of the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT). METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, 
      SPORTDiscus, and Scopus databases were searched up to October 2021. Data were 
      extracted from the retained studies and underwent methodological quality assessment 
      and meta-analysis using random-effect models. RESULTS: After screening, 33 articles 
      were included for the analyses. In all possible SEBT reach directions, the CAI group 
      demonstrated significantly decreased normalized dynamic reach distances relative to 
      the uninjured control group (SMDs: -0.66 to -0.48, p ≤ 0.05). Similarly, the 
      involved CAI limb demonstrated significantly decreased normalized dynamic reach 
      distances relative to the uninvolved CAI limb (SMDs: -0.61 to -0.33, p ≤ 0.05). 
      However, no differences were noted between the uninvolved CAI limb and the healthy 
      control limb (SMDs: -0.22 to 0.09, p ≥ 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings were that 
      the involved limb of those with CAI has dynamic postural deficits relative to (i) an 
      uninjured control group and (ii) relative to their uninvolved limb. However, the 
      uninvolved limb of the CAI group does not differ from an uninjured control group in 
      any reach direction.

TI  - Promoting healthy eating in the community sport setting: a scoping review.
LID - daab030 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/heapro/daab030 [doi]
AB  - Community sport organizations promote beneficial health outcomes such as social 
      connection and physical activity, yet they can also facilitate the consumption of 
      unhealthy food and beverages. To provide a foundation for future research and to 
      inform intervention efforts in this context, this scoping review summarizes existing 
      knowledge of the factors that contribute to unhealthy food and beverage consumption 
      in the community sport setting and explores the interventions to promote healthier 
      choices. Using a qualitative process aligned with the nature of our aims, 228 
      articles were initially identified and subjected to a systemized appraisal, 
      resulting in 45 articles pertinent to the review. The findings identify that the two 
      key factors contributing to unhealthy food choices are the limited availability of 
      healthy options within the sport setting and the presence of unhealthy food and 
      beverage sponsorship. These factors contribute to the normalization of unhealthy 
      eating in this context and health promotion interventions have had limited success. 
      Barriers to change primarily stem from the revenue implications of removing 
      unhealthy food sponsors, lack of organizational capabilities and resources, and 
      consumer preference for unhealthy options. Public health practitioners seeking to 
      intervene in this setting should consider adopting practices used in other settings 
      outside of the sport environment, including the use of technology, the role of peers 
      and mentors and the co-production of impactful material. Community sport plays a 
      vital role in delivering health benefits but must do more to stem its facilitation 
      of a potentially unhealthy consumptive environment.

AB  - Universal lipid screening (ULS) is recommended for all 9- to 11-year-old children. 
      We investigated ULS outcomes and long-term pediatrician management of children with 
      dyslipidemia using a retrospective chart review of well-child visits between 2014 
      and 2016. Descriptive statistics summarized demographics, ULS results, and follow-up 
      visits/testing. Pearson χ(2) test examined differences between those with and 
      without an abnormal screen. A total of 1039 children aged 9 to 11 years were seen 
      for a well-child visit; only 33.3% (343/1039) completed screening. Of children 
      screened, 18.1% (62/343) had abnormal screen results and were more likely to have an 
      elevated body mass index (P < .001), though 30.1% (19/62) had no risk factors. A 
      total of 10.2% (35/343) had dyslipidemia. A total of 77.1% of children with 
      dyslipidemia received nutrition/exercise counseling and 57.1% received dietitian 
      referrals; only 68.6% had a follow-up visit and 31.4% had repeat lipid testing. 
      Pediatricians would benefit from more practical strategies for universal testing 
      such as point-of-care testing and long-term management to ensure ULS is an effective 
      screening tool.

TI  - Sensory swap: Modelling the impact of swapping discretionary choices for similar 
      tasting core foods on the energy, nutrients and sensory properties of Australian 
      diets.

AB  - Food choice is strongly driven by the sensory characteristics of foods with sweet, 
      salty and fatty mouthfeel considered highly palatable and rewarding. Attempts to 
      improve diet quality have not addressed sensory characteristics of diets before. 
      This report describes a data modelling exercise that could underpin a dietary 
      strategy to help support consumption of higher quality diets without compromising 
      sensory preferences. This study used the Australian National Nutrition and Physical 
      Activity Survey data (in 9341 adults) and the CSIRO sensory-diet database. A method 
      was developed to find core food swaps which had a similar sensory profile as 
      discretionary foods. This study investigated the impact of such swaps on energy and 
      nutrient intake and the impact of the swaps on servings of food groups. The 
      modelling resulted in a similar sensory profile of core foods to that of 
      discretionary foods with hardness, sweetness and fatty mouthfeel all within 1-3% but 
      the saltiness approached a 4% change. There was a small (3.6%) increase in energy 
      intake. This swap strategy decreased the intake of risk nutrients such as saturated 
      fat and added sugars, but not sodium, while increasing the intake of beneficial 
      nutrients like calcium, zinc and vitamin C. Results also show that there was an 
      increase in the intake of servings of core food groups such as fruits, grains, and 
      dairy products but little change in vegetables. In conclusion, similar sensory swaps 
      are possible and could underpin a diet strategy, that could be further refined 
      through food appropriateness, to improve quality.

TI  - Lightest weight-class athletes are at higher risk of weight regain: results from the 
      French-Rapid Weight Loss Questionnaire.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1080/00913847.2021.2014285 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Rapid weight loss (RWL) is a common precompetitive strategy used by 
      athletes in weight-class sports and carries with it an increased risk to future 
      cardiometabolic health. The Rapid Weight Loss Questionnaire (RWLQ) is a 
      self-reported tool designed to identify and characterize such weight loss practices. 
      OBJECTIVES: After developing a reliable and reproducible French version of the RWLQ 
      (RWLQ-FR), the present study aims to analyse RWL patterns among French weight-class 
      athletes and to point out potential relationships between such practices and risk of 
      subsequent weight gain. METHODS: A test-retest analysis was performed in 54 athletes 
      to test the questionnaire reproducibility before applying it in a cohort of 168 
      weight-cycling athletes (23.78 ± 9.25 y, 67.6 ± 12.6 kg, 81 males and 87 females, n 
      = 24 strength sports and n = 144 various combat sports). RESULTS: The test-retest 
      showed good agreement of the RWLQ-FR (Rho = 0.794, [0.696-0.893]). Athletes reported 
      losing an average of 4.1 ± 2.9% of their initial weight in 13.1 ± 9.6 days, with the 
      main methods used being an increase in exercise, training in rubber or plastic 
      suits, and gradual dieting. The average weight recovery in a week was 3.5 ± 2.8% and 
      results showed that the athletes with the lower inter-season weight (weight outside 
      of the training and competition season) regained the more weight (p = 0.025). The 
      average RWLQ-FR score was 31.9 ± 17.3 and athletes who began to lose weight earlier 
      in their competitive carrier had the higher scores (p = 0.032). CONCLUSION: The 
      present study demonstrates relationships between the pattern of RWL practices and 
      potential increased risk of subsequent weight gain in weight-cycling athletes, and 
      the need to better understand the long-term health-related risks.

TI  - Improving Healthy Living in Residential Care Facilities: Feasibility, Acceptability, 
      and Appropriateness of Implementing a Multicomponent Intervention for Diabetes Risk 
      Reduction in Adults with Serious Mental Illnesses.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1007/s10488-022-01189-z [doi]
AB  - Persons with serious mental illnesses experience high rates of medical comorbidity, 
      especially diabetes. This study examined initial implementation feasibility, 
      acceptability, and appropriateness of a new 6-month Multicomponent Intervention for 
      Diabetes risk reduction in Adults with Serious mental illnesses (MIDAS) among 
      persons in residential care facilities (RCFs). We conducted a mixed-methods study 
      using four types of quantitative and qualitative data sources (administrative data; 
      structured facility-level observations; resident assessments including blood-based 
      biomarkers, 24-h dietary recalls, and self-report physical activity; and focus 
      groups/interviews with staff and participants), to assess evidence of and factors 
      affecting intervention feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness. It was 
      feasible to provide a high percentage of MIDAS class sessions (mean 50 of 52 
      intended sessions delivered) and make nutrition-related RCF changes (substitutions 
      for healthier food items and reduced portion sizes). Class attendance rates and 
      positive feedback from residents and staff provided evidence of MIDAS acceptability 
      and appropriateness for addressing identified health needs. The residents who 
      attended ≥ 85% of the sessions had greater improvement in several desired outcomes 
      compared to others. Implementing a fully integrated MIDAS model with more extensive 
      changes to facilities and more fundamental health changes among residents was more 
      challenging. While the study found evidence to support feasibility, acceptability, 
      and appropriateness of individual MIDAS components, some challenges for full 
      implementation and success in obtaining immediate health benefits were also 
      apparent. The study results highlight the need for improving health among RCF 
      populations and will inform MIDAS adaptations designed to improve intervention fit 
      and effectiveness outcomes.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to quantify the effect of adding sodium 
      alginate and pectin to a carbohydrate (CHO) beverage on exogenous glucose (ExGluc) 
      oxidation rate compared with an isocaloric CHO beverage. METHODS: Following 
      familiarization, eight well-trained endurance athletes performed four bouts of 
      prolonged running (105 min; 71 ± 4% of VO(2)max) while ingesting 175 mL of one of 
      the experimental beverages every 15 min. In randomized order, participants consumed 
      either 70 g(.)h(-1) of maltodextrin and fructose (10% CHO; NORM), 70 g(.)h(-1) of 
      maltodextrin, fructose, sodium alginate, and pectin (10% CHO; ENCAP), 180 g(.)h(-1) 
      of maltodextrin, fructose, sodium alginate, and pectin (26% CHO; HiENCAP), or water 
      (WAT). All CHO beverages had a maltodextrin:fructose ratio of 1:0.7 and contained 
      1.5 g(.)L(-1) of sodium chloride. Total substrate oxidation, ExGluc oxidation rate, 
      blood glucose, blood lactate, serum non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration, 
      and RPE were measured for every 15 min. Every 30 min participants provided 
      information regarding their gastrointestinal discomfort (GID). RESULTS: There was no 
      significant difference in peak ExGluc oxidation between NORM and ENCAP (0.63 ± 0.07 
      and 0.64 ± 0.11 g(.)min(-1), respectively; p > 0.5), both of which were 
      significantly lower than HiENCAP (1.13 ± 0.13 g(.)min(-1), p < 0.01). Both NORM and 
      HiENCAP demonstrated higher total CHO oxidation than WAT from 60 and 75 min, 
      respectively, until the end of exercise, with no differences between CHO trials. 
      During the first 60 min, blood glucose was significantly lower in WAT compared with 
      NORM and HiENCAP, but no differences were found between CHO beverages. Both ENCAP 
      and HiENCAP demonstrated a higher blood glucose concentration from 60-105 min than 
      WAT, and ENCAP was significantly higher than HiENCAP. There were no significant 
      differences in reported GID symptoms between the trials. CONCLUSIONS: At moderate 
      ingestion rates (i.e., 70 g(.)h(-1)), the addition of sodium alginate and pectin did 
      not influence the ExGluc oxidation rate compared with an isocaloric CHO beverage. At 
      very high ingestion rates (i.e., 180 g(.)h(-1)), high rates of ExGluc oxidation were 
      achieved in line with the literature.

AB  - Olympic combat sports are unconventional physical activity strategies to train 
      middle-aged and older people with and without health problems. This systematic 
      review aimed to assess the available body of published peer-reviewed articles 
      related to the effects of Olympic combat sports interventions (boxing, fencing, 
      judo, karate, taekwondo, wrestling) on health-related quality of life in adults aged 
      45 and older. The search was carried out in five generic databases until July 2021 
      and the protocol was registered in PROSPERO (code: CRD42021244161). The PRISMA 
      guidelines were followed and the Downs and Black checklist was used to assessed the 
      methodological quality of the studies. After reviewing 1,151 records, only seven 
      studies met the inclusion criteria, adding 212 participants (43.4% female) with a 
      mean age of 63.7 years. Six studies (two with middle-aged participants and four with 
      older people) provided data to calculate the effect size (ES) in the Olympic combat 
      sports groups (No research that used taekwondo or wrestling as an intervention 
      modality was found). Three studies reported beneficial changes with a small ES for 
      the total score (d < 0.40) of the health-related quality of life. Two studies 
      reported a beneficial change with a small ES (d = 0.49) and strong ES (d = 4.45) for 
      physical health. One study reported improvements with a small ES for emotional (d = 
      0.23) and functional (d = 0.26) well-being. In conclusion, interventions based on 
      Olympic combat sports produce beneficial effects with a small and moderate ES on 
      health-related quality of life in male and female aged 45 and older who are healthy 
      participants, participants with Parkinson's disease, and participants with breast 
      cancer. Systematic Review Registration: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/,

TI  - The CLOCK 3111T/C polymorphism is associated with hour-by-hour physical activity 
      levels only on weekends among Japanese male and female university students.

AB  - BACKGROUND: CLOCK 3111T/C has been shown to be closely associated with 
      morningness-eveningness, such as sleep-wake rhythms in healthy humans. However, 
      previous studies examined the physical activity (PA) in a single day, and no study 
      has investigated the relationships between CLOCK 3111T/C polymorphism and PA for an 
      entire week. It was hypothesized that the CLOCK 3111T/C polymorphism might be 
      associated with diurnal PA patterns, especially on the weekends. METHODS: Eighty-one 
      university students (male, n = 14; female, n = 67; age, 20.4 ± 2.9 years) wore a 
      digital accelerometer for 7 successive days, including the weekend, to collect 
      hour-by-hour objectively-measured PA. CLOCK 3111T/C polymorphism was assessed using 
      the oral mucosa. During the study, participants recorded their wake time and bedtime 
      each day. Furthermore, lifestyle-related variables (i.e. morningness-eveningness, 
      habitual meal and sleep timings) were collected using questionnaires. Linear 
      mixed-effects models assessed the association of polymorphism (TT carriers vs. TC+CC 
      carriers) with wake time and bedtime as well as daily PA throughout the week (time). 
      RESULTS: TT carriers had an earlier wake time (weekly mean: 44 min [95% CI, -82 to 
      -5 min], time interaction: p = 0.026) and bedtime (weekly mean: 30 min [95% CI, 
      -61 min to - 15 s], time interaction: p = 0.048) than TC+CC carriers. Furthermore, 
      TT carriers' wake time and bedtime on Saturday were significantly later than on 
      other days (gene interaction: all p < 0.05). On Saturday, the hour-by-hour PA in TT 
      carriers was significantly greater than that in TC+CC carriers (hourly mean 1.7 min 
      [95% CI, 0.2 to 3.4 min], time: p < 0.001, group: p = 0.028, interaction: 
      p = 0.155). CONCLUSIONS: CLOCK 3111T/C polymorphism may be associated with 
      objectively measured hour-by-hour PA only on Saturday. Academic/social obligations 
      may mask the genetically determined biological rhythm of PA on weekdays.

TI  - Inflammatory markers as correlates of body composition and grip strength among 
      adults with and without HIV: A cross-sectional study in Ethiopia.
LID - 10.1038/s41430-021-01056-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Changes in body composition and muscle strength are common among 
      individuals with HIV. We investigated the associations of inflammation with body 
      composition and grip strength in adults with and without HIV. METHODS: 
      Cross-sectional study among Ethiopian treatment-naïve individuals with and without 
      HIV. Fat mass and fat-free mass adjusted for height (kg/m(2)) were used as 
      indicators of body composition. RESULTS: 288/100 individuals with/without HIV were 
      included between July 2010 and August 2012. Females with HIV had lower fat mass 
      index (FMI) and fat-free mass index (FFMI) than females without HIV, whereas no 
      difference was seen between males with and without HIV. Males and females with HIV 
      had lower grip strength than their counterparts without HIV. Serum alpha-1-acid 
      glycoprotein (s-AGP) was negatively correlated with FMI (-0.71 kg/m(2), 95% CI: 
      -1.2; -0.3) among individuals with HIV, and those with HIV and serum C-reactive 
      protein (s-CRP) ≥ 10 mg/l had 0.78 kg/m(2) (95% CI -1.4; -0.2) lower FMI than those 
      with s-CRP < 10 mg/l. In contrast, s-AGP was positively correlated with FMI 
      (2.09 kg/m(2), 95% CI 0.6; 3.6) in individuals without HIV. S-CRP and AGP were 
      negatively associated with grip strength in individuals with HIV, while no 
      correlation was observed among those without HIV. CONCLUSION: Inflammation was 
      positively associated with FMI in individuals without HIV while it was negatively 
      associated with FMI in those with HIV, indicating that inflammation may be one of 
      the drivers of depleting energy reserves among treatment-naïve individuals with HIV. 
      Inflammation was associated with decreased muscle quantity and functional capacity 
      among individuals with HIV, but not in those without HIV.

TI  - Determinants of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Infection Among University Students in 
      Central Bangladesh.
PG  - 136-142
LID - 10.1007/s10900-021-01025-9 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence and determinants of hepatitis B 
      virus (HBV) infection among university students in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional 
      study was conducted among 614 students from five universities in central Bangladesh. 
      Data were collected on demographic information, immunization history, medical and 
      blood transfusion history through the face-to-face interview. Blood samples were 
      collected and screened for anti-HBsAg using ELISA, HBsAg Rapid Test-cassette, and 
      immune chromatographic test. The overall seroprevalence of HBV infection was 5.0%, 
      and vaccination coverage was 19.2% among the participants. Students having a history 
      of surgery (OR 11.004, 95% CI 3.211-37.707), blood transfusion (OR 5.651, 95% CI 
      0.965-33.068), being married (OR 4.776, 95% CI 1.508-15.127), and not being 
      vaccinated (OR 9.825, 95% CI 1.130-85.367) were at higher risk of being infected by 
      HBV. This study showed the endemicity of HBV infection among the Bangladeshi 
      population. Marriage, surgical or blood transfusion history, not being vaccinated 
      were the determinants of HBV infection within the study population. Public health

TI  - Prospective Associations of Leisure-Time Physical Activity With Psychological 
      Distress and Well-Being: A 12-Year Cohort Study.
PG  - 116-122
LID - 10.1097/PSY.0000000000001023 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the associations of leisure-time physical 
      activity with psychological distress and well-being, and potential mediators. 
      METHODS: We used data from the 1970 British Cohort Study (n = 5197; 2688 men), 
      including waves 34y (2004), 42y (2012), and 46y (2016). Participants reported 
      leisure-time physical activity frequency and intensity (exposure) at age 34 years 
      (baseline); cognition (vocabulary test), body mass index, disability, mobility and 
      pain perception (potential mediators) at age 42 years; and psychological distress 
      (Malaise Inventory) and well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh scale) at age 46 years. 
      Baseline confounders included sex, country, education, employment status, alcohol 
      use, tobacco smoking, and psychological distress. Main analyses included logistic 
      regression and mediation models. RESULTS: Higher leisure-time physical activity 
      intensity at baseline was associated with lower psychological distress at 46y (β = 
      -0.038 [95% confidence interval {CI} =-0.069 to -0.007]), but not leisure-time 
      physical activity frequency. Baseline leisure-time physical activity frequency and 
      intensity were associated with higher psychological well-being at 46y (frequency: β 
      = 0.089 [95% CI = 0.002 to 0.176]; intensity: β = 0.262 [95% CI = 0.123 to 0.401]); 
      and total: β = 0.041 [95% CI = 0.013 to 0.069]). Only body mass index at 42y 
      partially mediated the association between leisure-time physical activity frequency 
      (15.7%) and total leisure-time physical activity (6.2%) at 34y, with psychological 
      well-being at 46y. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the role of leisure-time 
      physical activity in psychological distress and well-being, with greater effect 
      sizes associated with higher frequency and intensity of leisure-time physical 
      activity. Future interventions should consider examining potential mediators of the 
      association of leisure-time physical activity with psychological well-being, such as 
      body mass index.

TI  - Oxidative and glycolytic skeletal muscles deploy protective mechanisms to avoid 
      atrophy under pathophysiological iron overload.
LID - 10.1002/jcsm.12897 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron excess has been proposed as an essential factor in skeletal muscle 
      wasting. Studies have reported correlations between muscle iron accumulation and 
      atrophy, either through ageing or by using experimental models of secondary iron 
      overload. However, iron treatments performed in most of these studies induced an 
      extra-pathophysiological iron overload, more representative of intoxication or 
      poisoning. The main objective of this study was to determine the impact of iron 
      excess closer to pathophysiological conditions on structural and metabolic 
      adaptations (i) in differentiated myotubes and (ii) in skeletal muscle exhibiting 
      oxidative (i.e. the soleus) or glycolytic (i.e. the gastrocnemius) metabolic 
      phenotypes. METHODS: The impact of iron excess was assessed in both in vitro and in 
      vivo models. Murine differentiated myotubes were exposed to ferric ammonium citrate 
      (FAC) (i.e. 10 and 50 μM) for the in vitro component. The in vivo model was achieved 
      by a single iron dextran subcutaneous injection (1 g/kg) in mice. Four months after 
      the injection, soleus and gastrocnemius muscles were harvested for analysis. 
      RESULTS: In vitro, iron exposure caused dose-dependent increases of iron storage 
      protein ferritin (P < 0.01) and dose-dependent decreases of mRNA TfR1 levels 
      (P < 0.001), which support cellular adaptations to iron excess. Extra-physiological 
      iron treatment (50 μM FAC) promoted myotube atrophy (P = 0.018), whereas myotube 
      size remained unchanged under pathophysiological treatment (10 μM FAC). FAC 
      treatments, whatever the doses tested, did not affect the expression of proteolytic 
      markers (i.e. NF-κB, MurF1, and ubiquitinated proteins). In vivo, basal iron content 
      and mRNA TfR1 levels were significantly higher in the soleus compared with the 
      gastrocnemius (+130% and +127%; P < 0.001, respectively), supporting higher iron 
      needs in oxidative skeletal muscle. Iron supplementation induced muscle iron 
      accumulation in the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles (+79%, P < 0.001 and +34%, 
      P = 0.002, respectively), but ferritin protein expression only increased in the 
      gastrocnemius (+36%, P = 0.06). Despite iron accumulation, muscle weight, fibre 
      diameter, and myosin heavy chain distribution remained unchanged in either skeletal 
      muscle. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data support that under pathophysiological 
      conditions, skeletal muscle can protect itself from the related deleterious effects 
      of excess iron.

TI  - Tai Chi Improves Brain Functional Connectivity and Plasma Lysophosphatidylcholines 
      in Postmenopausal Women With Knee Osteoarthritis: An Exploratory Pilot Study.
PG  - 775344
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2021.775344 [doi]
LID - 775344
AB  - Objective: A pre/post pilot study was designed to investigate neurobiological 
      mechanisms and plasma metabolites in an 8-week Tai-Chi (TC) group intervention in 
      subjects with knee osteoarthritis. Methods: Twelve postmenopausal women underwent 
      Tai-Chi group exercise for 8 weeks (60 min/session, three times/week). Outcomes were 
      measured before and after Tai Chi intervention including pain intensity (VAS), Brief 
      Pain Inventory (BPI), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index 
      (WOMAC), plasma metabolites (amino acids and lipids), as well as resting-state 
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI, 10 min, eyes open), diffusion tensor 
      imaging (DTI, 12 min), and structural MRI (4.5 min) in a subgroup. Clinical data was 
      analyzed using paired t-tests; plasma metabolites were analyzed using Wilcoxon 
      signed-rank tests; and rs-fMRI data were analyzed using seed-based correlations of 
      the left and right amygdala in a two-level mixed-effects model (FSL software). 
      Correlations between amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) connectivity and 
      corresponding changes in clinical outcomes were examined. DTI connectivity of each 
      amygdala was modeled using a Bayesian approach and probabilistic tractography. The 
      associations between neurobiological effects and pain/physical function were 
      examined. Results: Significant pre/post changes were observed with reduced knee pain 
      (VAS with most pain: p = 0.018; WOMAC-pain: p = 0.021; BPI with worst level: p = 
      0.018) and stiffness (WOMAC-stiffness, p = 0.020), that likely contributed to 
      improved physical function (WOMAC-physical function: p = 0.018) with TC. Moderate to 
      large effect sizes pre/post increase in rs-fMRI connectivity were observed between 
      bilateral mPFC and the amygdala seed regions (i.e., left: d = 0.988, p = 0.355; 
      right: d = 0.600, p = 0.282). Increased DTI connectivity was observed between 
      bilateral mPFC and left amygdala (d = 0.720, p = 0.156). There were moderate-high 
      correlations (r = 0.28-0.60) between TC-associated pre-post changes in amygdala-mPFC 
      functional connectivity and pain/physical function improvement. Significantly higher 
      levels of lysophosphatidylcholines were observed after TC but lower levels of some 
      essential amino acids. Amino acid levels (alanine, lysine, and methionine) were 
      lower after 8 weeks of TC and many of the lipid metabolites were higher after TC. 
      Further, plasma non-HDL cholesterol levels were lower after TC. Conclusion: This 
      pilot study showed moderate to large effect sizes, suggesting an important role that 
      cortico-amygdala interactions related to TC have on pain and physical function in 
      subjects with knee osteoarthritis pain. Metabolite analyses revealed a metabolic 
      shift of higher lyso-lipids and lower amino acids that might suggest greater fatty 
      acid catabolism, protein turnover and changes in lipid redistribution in response to 
      TC exercise. The results also support therapeutic strategies aimed at strengthening 
      functional and structural connectivity between the mPFC and the amygdala. Controlled 
      clinical trials are warranted to confirm these observed preliminary effects.

AB  - Endurance training and explosive strength training, with different contraction 
      protein and energy metabolism adaptation in skeletal muscle, are both beneficial for 
      physical function and quality of life. Our previous study found that chronic 
      succinate feeding enhanced the endurance exercise of mice by inducing skeletal 
      muscle fiber-type transformation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the 
      effect of acute succinate administration on skeletal muscle explosive strength and 
      its potential mechanism. Succinate was injected to mature mice to explore the acute 
      effect of succinate on skeletal muscle explosive strength. And C2C12 cells were used 
      to verify the short-term effect of succinate on oxidative phosphorylation. Then the 
      cells interfered with succinate receptor 1 (SUCNR1) siRNA, and the SUCNR1-GKO mouse 
      model was used for verifying the role of SUCNR1 in succinate-induced muscle 
      metabolism and expression and explosive strength. The results showed that acute 
      injection of succinate remarkably improved the explosive strength in mice and also 
      decreased the ratio of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to NAD(+) and 
      increased the mitochondrial complex enzyme activity and creatine kinase (CK) 
      activity in skeletal muscle tissue. Similarly, treatment of C2C12 cells with 
      succinate revealed that succinate significantly enhanced oxidative phosphorylation 
      with increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, CK, and the activities of 
      mitochondrial complex I and complex II, but with decreased lactate content, reactive 
      oxygen species (ROS) content, and NADH/NAD(+) ratio. Moreover, the succinate's 
      effects on oxidative phosphorylation were blocked in SUCNR1-KD cells and SUCNR1-KO 
      mice. In addition, succinate-induced explosive strength was also abolished by SUCNR1 
      knockout. All the results indicate that acute succinate administration increases 
      oxidative phosphorylation and skeletal muscle explosive strength in a 
      SUCNR1-dependent manner.

AB  - We aimed to analyze personality-related determinants of physical activity among 
      Polish and Spanish physical education (PE) students. The study was conducted among 
      219 Polish and 280 Spanish PE students, using the International Physical Activity 
      Questionnaire (IPAQ) and the NEO-FFI Personality Inventory. Compared with Spanish PE 
      students, their Polish counterparts are characterized by a higher level of 
      extraversion and conscientiousness and a lower level of neuroticism. The level of 
      total physical activity for all students was 8,697.21 METs, and this value was 
      higher among Polish students. Among Polish and Spanish PE students, the level of 
      total, vigorous, and moderate physical activity increased along with the increase in 
      extraversion, while a decrease occurred along with the increase in neuroticism. The 
      level of each domain of physical activity also increased in line with the 
      intensification of student conscientiousness. In moderation analyses, it was shown 
      that the home country of students may be considered a moderator of the relationship 
      between conscientiousness and total exercise in such a way that the physical 
      activity increased along with the increase in conscientiousness only among the 
      Polish students. In addition, the country is a moderator of the correlation between 
      moderate physical activity and neuroticism (p = 0.031), openness (p = 0.049), and 
      conscientiousness (p = 0.019), with moderate activity only decreasing among Polish 
      students and increasing along with the increase in openness and conscientiousness. 
      Positive correlations among physical activity, extraversion, and conscientiousness, 
      as well as negative ones with neuroticism, were demonstrated among Polish and 
      Spanish students, and also the moderating impact of the country on the correlation 
      between personality-related dimensions and physical activity.

TI  - A Comparison of the External and Internal Demands Imposed during Conditioning 
      Training and Match-Play in Semi-Professional and Development Female Netball Players.

LID - 12
AB  - This case series, team-based study aimed to compare the demands imposed during 
      conditioning training and match-play in netball players. Female netball players 
      competing at semi-professional (n = 9, age: 22.2 ± 3.8 years) and development (n = 
      9, age: 22.3 ± 2.9 years) levels had their internal (rating of perceived exertion 
      (RPE)) and external (relative PlayerLoad (PL) in total and in the forwards, 
      sideways, and vertical vectors) loads measured during conditioning-based training 
      sessions and matches in a season. Demand variables were compared between 
      conditioning and match-play across all players and according to position in each 
      playing level. Conditioning training imposed higher relative PL in total and in each 
      vector compared to match-play in semi-professional and development players (small to 
      large effects). In contrast, RPE was significantly (p = 0.006) higher during 
      match-play than conditioning training in semi-professional and development players 
      (medium effects). Furthermore, according to playing position, significantly higher 
      relative PL variables were evident during conditioning training than match-play in 
      wing attack and goalkeeper semi-professional players and in goal attack, goal 
      shooter, goal keeper, and goal defence development players. These results suggest 
      conditioning training practices elicit adequate external intensities but inadequate 
      internal intensities relative to match-play across positions in semi-professional 
      and development netball players.

AB  - Heat stress decreases human physical work capacity (PWC), but the extent to which 
      solar radiation (SOLAR) compounds this response is not well understood. This study 
      empirically quantified how SOLAR impacts PWC in the heat, considering wide, but 
      controlled, variations in air temperature, humidity, and clothing coverage. We also 
      provide correction equations so PWC can be quantified outdoors using heat stress 
      indices that do not ordinarily account for SOLAR (including the Heat Stress Index, 
      Humidex, and Wet-Bulb Temperature). Fourteen young adult males (7 donning a work 
      coverall, 7 with shorts and trainers) walked for 1 h at a fixed heart rate of 130 
      beats∙min(-)1, in seven combinations of air temperature (25 to 45°C) and relative 
      humidity (20 or 80%), with and without SOLAR (800 W/m(2) from solar lamps). 
      Cumulative energy expenditure in the heat, relative to the work achieved in a cool 
      reference condition, was used to determine PWC%. Skin temperature was the primary 
      determinant of PWC in the heat. In dry climates with exposed skin (0.3 Clo), SOLAR 
      caused PWC to decrease exponentially with rising air temperature, whereas work 
      coveralls (0.9 Clo) negated this effect. In humid conditions, the SOLAR-induced 
      reduction in PWC was consistent and linear across all levels of air temperature and 
      clothing conditions. Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature and the Universal Thermal Climate 
      Index represented SOLAR correctly and did not require a correction factor. For the 
      Heat Stress Index, Humidex, and Wet-Bulb Temperature, correction factors are 
      provided enabling forecasting of heat effects on work productivity.

TI  - #Skinny girls: young girls' learning processes and health-related social media.
PG  - 1-18
LID - 10.1080/2159676X.2021.1888152 [doi]
AB  - This paper provides in-depth knowledge into young girls' learning processes in 
      relation to physical activity, diet/nutrition and body image. Data were generated 
      from interviews with 49 girls (age 13-15) in England. The practical epistemological 
      analysis technique was used to explore young people as both producers and consumers, 
      or prosumers, of content and knowledge. The data illustrate that adolescent girls 
      navigate two interrelated health-related paradoxes within publicly private spaces: 
      (i) skinny fat and (ii) naturally fake. Skinny fat refers to how participation in 
      social media represents a continuous struggle of becoming skinny, but at the same 
      time not trying too hard to become too skinny. Naturally fake refers to how having a 
      'natural' look is highly valued, but equally, it is acceptable to be 'fake'. 
      Overall, adolescent girls are competent users of social media, who are able to 
      navigate the complexity of the medium and its contents. At the same time, the 
      adolescent girls sometimes found themselves, unintentionally, exposed to risks (e.g. 
      bullying or body dysmorphia), particularly when social media was experienced 
      publicly in a temporal order, connected to the past or present, and without control 
      of potential future effects and impacts. Relevant adults should acknowledge young 
      people's vast competence of life on social media and further empower young people to 
      self-regulate their learning through social media, and in ways that help them to 
      learn from experiences about their health and bodies to shape future actions.

TI  - Infancy weight faltering and childhood neurodevelopmental disorders: a general 
      population birth-cohort study.
LID - 10.1007/s00787-021-01915-2 [doi]
AB  - While it is known that intrauterine growth restriction is associated with later 
      mental disorders, it is still unclear whether similar associations exists for 
      postnatal weight faltering, also known as 'failure to thrive' in infancy. This study 
      examined the potential connection between infancy weight faltering and mental 
      disorders diagnosed in childhood focusing specifically on neurodevelopmental 
      disorders. The Copenhagen Child Cohort (CCC2000) was used to explore weight gain in 
      infancy assessed by community health nurses. Data from the Danish national 
      registries were used to quantify ICD-10 mental disorders diagnosed between birth and 
      12 years of age, as well as potential child and family confounders. Of 4.476 
      children with sufficient weight data, 339 (7.3%) children were diagnosed with a 
      mental disorder in childhood. Both any (weight gain < -1SD) and severe infancy 
      weight faltering (weight gain < -2SD) were associated with psychomotor delays, while 
      severe infancy weight faltering was also associated with intellectual impairments. 
      Notably, no significant associations were found between weight faltering and autism 
      spectrum disorders or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders. Weight faltering in 
      infancy may be an early marker of neurodevelopmental delays. This possibility should 
      be considered when assessing infants with slow weight gain, to early identification 
      and treatment of co-occurring neurodevelopmental disorders.

TI  - The association between general and central obesity and the risks of coronary heart 
      disease in women with and without a familial predisposition to obesity: findings 
      from the Danish Nurse Cohort.
PG  - 433-436
LID - 10.1038/s41366-021-00990-4 [doi]
AB  - Several studies show an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) among people 
      with obesity, but it is largely unknown whether this association also depends on a 
      familial predisposition to obesity. This study examined if associations between Body 
      Mass Index (BMI) or waist circumference (WC) and incident CHD differed among Danish 
      female nurses with and without familial overweight and obesity. Analyses were based 
      on data from the Danish Nurse Cohort (n = 20,701). Self-reported height, weight and 
      self-measured WC were assessed in 1999, as was information on familial 
      overweight/obesity, defined as having one or both parents with overweight/obesity. 
      Information on the development of or death from CHD was collected from nationwide 
      Danish registries in 2015. Analyses were based on Cox proportional hazard regression 
      models adjusted for potential confounding factors. Both BMI and WC were directly 
      associated with CHD risk, but we found no evidence of effect modification from 
      familial predisposition to obesity. Hence a familial predisposition to obesity does 
      not seem to influence the risk of CHD associated with general or central obesity.

TI  - Compromised hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and reduced markers of 
      mitochondrial turnover in human NAFLD.
LID - 10.1002/hep.32324 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its more advanced 
      form steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with obesity and is an independent risk 
      factor for cardiovascular, liver-related, and all-cause mortality. Available human 
      data examining hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and hepatic mitochondrial 
      turnover in NAFLD and NASH are scant. To investigate this relationship, liver 
      biopsies were obtained from patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery and 
      data clustered into four groups based on hepatic histopathological classification: 
      Control (no disease), NAFL (steatosis only), Borderline-NASH (steatosis with lobular 
      inflammation or hepatocellular ballooning), and Definite-NASH (steatosis, lobular 
      inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning). RESULTS: Hepatic mitochondrial 
      complete fatty acid oxidation to CO(2) and the rate limiting enzyme in β-oxidation 
      (β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity) were reduced by ~40-50% with D-NASH 
      compared with Control. This corresponded with increased hepatic mitochondrial 
      reactive oxygen species production, as well as dramatic reductions in markers of 
      mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy, mitophagy, fission and fusion in NAFL and NASH. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that compromised hepatic fatty acid oxidation 
      and mitochondrial turnover are intimately linked to increasing NAFLD severity in 
      patients with obesity.

AB  - Children with Down syndrome (DS) exhibit higher overweight and obesity rates than 
      their typically developing peers, although it is unknown whether parent feeding 
      practices for children with DS are associated with child weight status or parental 
      and demographic factors, especially in the Hispanic and Latino populations. A 
      prospective study of 68 children with DS from 2 to 7 years of age, who received care 
      at a single, large, pediatric academic hospital was conducted to evaluate parent 
      child feeding practices. Parents completed the Child Feeding Questionnaire+ (CFQ+) 
      assessing seven primary factors of feeding practices and comparisons to children 
      without DS were conducted. Data for body mass index (BMI) and BMI-for-sex/age z 
      score (BMIz scores) were collected in clinic at the time of CFQ+ completion for both 
      parent and child. Parents of children with DS endorsed higher perceived 
      responsibility but lower concern about child weight and restriction compared to 
      previously reported feeding practices in typically developing children. 
      Hispanic/Latino parents of children with DS reported higher perceived responsibility 
      and monitoring than non-Hispanic/Latino parents of children with DS. Higher BMIz 
      scores in children with DS correlated with greater perceived child weight 
      (p = 0.001) and concern about child weight (p = 0.008). Differences in BMIz scores 
      were observed when comparing sex/ethnicity groups as determined by one-way ANOVA 
      (F(3,64) = 4.170, p = 0.009); with Hispanic/Latino boys with DS more likely to have 
      obesity. Our results suggest a need for specific DS Guidelines to educate providers 
      and parents of children with DS on recommended feeding practices prior to parental 
      concern about their child's weight, especially in the Hispanic/Latino population.

      immersion as a recovery modality in elite football.
PG  - 19-29
LID - 10.5114/biolsport.2021.103570 [doi]
AB  - Optimal strategies for recovery following training and competition in elite athletes 
      presents ongoing debate. The effects of cold-water immersion (CWI) compared to 
      passive recovery (PR) though a triad of performance measures after fatiguing 
      exercise within a normal micro-cycle, during mid-competitive training cycle, in 
      elite male footballers were investigated. Twenty-four elite footballers (age 20.58 ± 
      2.55 years; height 179.9 ± 5.6 cm; weight 75.7 ± 7.5 kg; body fat 6.2 ± 1.7%) were 
      randomly assigned to CWI or PR following a fatiguing training session. Objective 
      measures included eccentric hamstring strength, isometric adductor strength, 
      hamstring flexibility and skin surface temperature (T (sk) ). Subjective measures 
      included overall wellbeing. Data were collected at match day+3, immediately 
      post-training, immediately post-intervention and 24 hrs post-intervention. 
      Physiological, biomechanical and psychological measures displayed significant main 
      effects for timepoint for eccentric hamstring strength, T (sk) , overall wellbeing, 
      sleep, fatigue, stress and group for eccentric hamstring strength, T (sk) and sleep 
      (groups combined). Group responses identified significant effects for timepoint for 
      CWI and PR, for eccentric hamstring strength peak force, sleep, fatigue, and muscle 
      soreness for CWI. Significant differences were displayed for eccentric hamstring 
      strength (immediately post-intervention and immediately post-training) for peak 
      force and between CWI and PR eccentric hamstring strength immediately 
      post-intervention. Linear regression for individual analysis demonstrated greater 
      recovery in peak torque and force for CWI. CWI may be useful to ameliorate potential 
      deficits in eccentric hamstring strength that optimise readiness to train/play in 
      elite football settings. Multiple measures and individual analysis of recovery 
      responses provides sports medicine and performance practitioners with direction on 
      the application of modified approaches to recovery strategies, within 
      mid-competitive season training cycles.

TI  - Sarcopenia Is a Cause and Consequence of Metabolic Dysregulation in Aging Humans: 
      Effects of Gut Dysbiosis, Glucose Dysregulation, Diet and Lifestyle.
LID - 10.3390/cells11030338 [doi]
LID - 338
AB  - Skeletal muscle mass plays a critical role in a healthy lifespan by helping to 
      regulate glucose homeostasis. As seen in sarcopenia, decreased skeletal muscle mass 
      impairs glucose homeostasis, but it may also be caused by glucose dysregulation. Gut 
      microbiota modulates lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production, short-chain fatty acids 
      (SCFA), and various metabolites that affect the host metabolism, including skeletal 
      muscle tissues, and may have a role in the sarcopenia etiology. Here, we aimed to 
      review the relationship between skeletal muscle mass, glucose homeostasis, and gut 
      microbiota, and the effect of consuming probiotics and prebiotics on the development 
      and pathological consequences of sarcopenia in the aging human population. This 
      review includes discussions about the effects of glucose metabolism and gut 
      microbiota on skeletal muscle mass and sarcopenia and the interaction of dietary 
      intake, physical activity, and gut microbiome to influence sarcopenia through 
      modulating the gut-muscle axis. Emerging evidence suggests that the microbiome can 
      regulate both skeletal muscle mass and function, in part through modulating the 
      metabolisms of short-chain fatty acids and branch-chain amino acids that might act 
      directly on muscle in humans or indirectly through the brain and liver. Dietary 
      factors such as fats, proteins, and indigestible carbohydrates and lifestyle 
      interventions such as exercise, smoking, and alcohol intake can both help and hinder 
      the putative gut-muscle axis. The evidence presented in this review suggests that 
      loss of muscle mass and function are not an inevitable consequence of the aging 
      process, and that dietary and lifestyle interventions may prevent or delay 
      sarcopenia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the public health significance of overweight and obesity, weight 
      management has remained a low priority for health-related programming on university 
      campuses. OBJECTIVE: Investigate the need for and feasibility of implementing 
      university-based weight loss programs. METHODS: The Practical, Robust Implementation 
      and Sustainability Model (PRISM) was used as a framework. Semi-structured individual 
      interviews were conducted with fifteen university staff and students from two large 
      U.S. universities in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. Interviews aimed to assess 
      readiness, preferences, characteristics, barriers and facilitators in each of the 
      four adapted PRISM domains: (1) Organizational and Recipient (Student) Perspectives 
      on the Intervention, (2) Recipient (Student) Characteristics, (3) Internal 
      Environment (organizational characteristics and infrastructure), and (4) External 
      Environment. Verbatim transcriptions were analyzed using inductive and deductive 
      thematic analyses. Themes were extracted as outlined by Consensual Qualitative 
      Research. RESULTS: Participants supported university-based weight loss programs, but 
      recognized barriers of resources, coordination across entities, and competing health 
      issues taking priority for school programming. Campus built environment and 
      students' busy schedules were identified as barriers to maintaining healthy weight 
      and participation in weight loss programs. Recommendations included designing weight 
      loss programming with a positive and holistic approach, minimizing weight-stigma, 
      ensuring support from university leaders and students, and securing external 
      funding. CONCLUSIONS: The identified themes provide recommendations for universities 
      looking to develop and implement weight loss programming.

TI  - Improved power clean performance with the hook-grip is not due to altered force-time 
      or horizontal bar-path characteristics.
PG  - 226-235
LID - 10.1080/02640414.2021.1986270 [doi]
AB  - he underlying biomechanical benefits of hook-grip (HG) over conventional 
      closed-grip (CG) remain unclear. This study compared bar-path kinematics and 
      force-time variables of the power clean (PC) performed with HG or CG. We also aimed 
      to compared kinetic changes measured by force platform versus linear position 
      transducer (LPT). Eleven well-trained men volunteered. Following a familiarisation 
      session, HG, and CG 1RM conditions, were randomly completed seven days apart. System 
      kinetics and barbell kinematics were recorded via synchronized force platform+LPT 
      system and two-dimensional motion-capture. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM), 
      analysis of variance, and standardised differences were utilised. The SPM cut-offs 
      were determined via novel combination of force and displacement. No 
      between-condition differences in normalised force-time variables of the pull or 
      catch were detected. The first and second pull duration was similar between 
      conditions (ES = 0.04-0.38). Conversely, catch and total PC durations were shorter 
      at 80-95% (ES = 0.26-0.75), with the weightless phase more prolonged at 95% and 100% 
      (ES = 0.54-0.76) with HG compared to CG. Improved timing of the turnover and catch 
      phases appears to be the primary difference between HG and CG performance. Thus, 
      grip type is possibly irrelevant to non-weightlifting athletes when performing 
      submaximal catch-less derivatives..

TI  - Differential Effects of One Meal per Day in the Evening on Metabolic Health and 
      Physical Performance in Lean Individuals.
PG  - 771944
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2021.771944 [doi]
LID - 771944
AB  - Background: Generally, food intake occurs in a three-meal per 24 h fashion with 
      in-between meal snacking. As such, most humans spend more than ∼ 12-16 h per day in 
      the postprandial state. It may be reasoned from an evolutionary point of view, that 
      the human body is physiologically habituated to less frequent meals. Metabolic 
      flexibility (i.e., reciprocal changes in carbohydrate and fatty acid oxidation) is a 
      characteristic of metabolic health and is reduced by semi-continuous feeding. The 
      effects of time-restricted feeding (TRF) on metabolic parameters and physical 
      performance in humans are equivocal. Methods: To investigate the effect of TRF on 
      metabolism and physical performance in free-living healthy lean individuals, we 
      compared the effects of eucaloric feeding provided by a single meal (22/2) vs. three 
      meals per day in a randomized crossover study. We included 13 participants of which 
      11 (5 males/6 females) completed the study: age 31.0 ± 1.7 years, BMI 24.0 ± 0.6 
      kg/m(2) and fat mass (%) 24.0 ± 0.6 (mean ± SEM). Participants consumed all the 
      calories needed for a stable weight in either three meals (breakfast, lunch and 
      dinner) or one meal per day between 17:00 and 19:00 for 11 days per study period. 
      Results: Eucaloric meal reduction to a single meal per day lowered total body mass 
      (3 meals/day -0.5 ± 0.3 vs. 1 meal/day -1.4 ± 0.3 kg, p = 0.03), fat mass (3 
      meals/day -0.1 ± 0.2 vs. 1 meal/day -0.7 ± 0.2, p = 0.049) and increased exercise 
      fatty acid oxidation (p < 0.001) without impairment of aerobic capacity or strength 
      (p > 0.05). Furthermore, we found lower plasma glucose concentrations during the 
      second half of the day during the one meal per day intervention (p < 0.05). 
      Conclusion: A single meal per day in the evening lowers body weight and adapts 
      metabolic flexibility during exercise via increased fat oxidation whereas physical 
      performance was not affected.

TI  - Approach to the patient with Prader-Willi syndrome.
LID - dgac082 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgac082 [doi]
AB  - Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare, multi-systemic, genetic disorder involving 
      the hypothalamus. It is caused by loss of expression of paternally inherited genes 
      in chromosome 15 q11-13 region. The estimated incidence is around 1 in 20.000 
      births. PWS is characterized by a complex lifelong trajectory involving 
      neurodevelopmental, nutritional, endocrine, metabolic and behavioral changes. The 
      major symptoms are hypotonia, short stature, hypogonadism, and eating disorders 
      ranging from anorexia in infancy to hyperphagia, a deficit of satiety, and a high 
      risk of severe obesity. The patients display intellectual disability comprising 
      cognitive deficit, delayed motor, and language development, learning deficits, 
      impaired social skills, and emotional regulation. Behavioral features including 
      temper outbursts, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms and rigidity are common and 
      become more apparent with increasing age. Almost all have hypogonadism and growth 
      hormone deficiency. Central adrenal insufficiency is rare whereas central 
      hypothyroidism occurs in up to 30% of children with PWS. The prevalence of obesity 
      increases with age from almost none in early childhood to more than 90% in 
      adulthood. Up to 25% of adults with obesity have type 2 diabetes. Obesity and its 
      complications are the major causes of comorbidity and mortality in PWS. As there is 
      no specific treatment care consists of comprehensive management of feeding 
      disorders, a restricted, controlled diet, regular exercise, hormone substitution and 
      screening and treatment of comorbidities. Here we present the course of PWS from 
      birth to adulthood in two patients and discuss their symptoms in relation to the 
      literature.

TI  - Associations between sedentary behaviour patterns and depression among people aged 
      60 and older in Hebei Province of China.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sedentary behaviours (SBs) are now considered a risk factor for 
      depression. Older adults are sedentary most of the time and are at a high risk of 
      depression. However, not all types of SBs have adverse effects on mental health. 
      Passive SBs (such as watching TV) increase the risk of depression, whereas mentally 
      active SBs (such as using the internet and reading) decrease the risk of depression. 
      The aim of this study was to explore the associations between type of SBs (i.e., 
      passive and mentally active SBs) and depression among people aged 60 years and older 
      in the Hebei Province of China. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used data from 
      the baseline survey of the Community-based Cohort Study on Nervous System Diseases. 
      A total of 2679 older adults aged ≥60 years from the Hebei Province of China were 
      included in this study. The type and time spent on SBs were self-reported. Watching 
      TV was defined as a passive SB, whereas internet use, reading, and social SBs 
      (including communicating with others and playing chess) were defined as mentally 
      active SBs. Depression was evaluated using the Geriatric Depression Scale. The 
      maximal possible score was 30 points, and ≥ 11 points indicated depression. Logistic 
      regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between SBs and depression. 
      Covariates included sex, age, education, employment, smoking, alcohol consumption, 
      sleep duration, domestic work, physical exercise, body mass index (BMI), and chronic 
      diseases. RESULTS: At baseline, the participants who spent two or more hours and 0 h 
      on passive SBs (i.e., TV viewing) had a greater risk of depression (=0 h: adjusted 
      OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.18-3.76; 2-3 h: OR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.16-4.16; > 3 h: 
      OR = 3.59, 95% CI = 1.93-6.68) than the participants who spent 1-2 h on passive SBs. 
      The participants who spent > 1 h on mentally active SBs had a lower risk of 
      depression (adjusted OR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.06-0.71) than the participants who did 
      not engage in mentally active SBs. Not all mentally active SBs were linked to 
      depression. The participants who engaged in social SBs had a lower risk of 
      depression (adjusted OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.06-0.66) than the participants who did not 
      engage in social SBs. CONCLUSIONS: Spending 2 h or more per day on passive SBs 
      (watching TV) was associated with a high risk of depression among people aged 
      60 years and older in the Hebei Province of China. Mentally active SBs 
      (predominantly social SBs) could reduce the risk of depression. Some participants 
      with depression probably did not watch TV. These findings suggested that spending 
      more time on social SBs (such as communicating with others and playing chess) rather 
      than watching TV may have important public health implications for preventing and 
      managing depression among older Chinese adults. Moreover, society should attend to 
      the mental health of elderly adults who do not watch TV as they may be more prone to 
      suffer from depressive symptoms.

TI  - Early-stage studies to larger-scale trials: investigators' perspectives on 
      scaling-up childhood obesity interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pilot/feasibility studies play an important role in the development and 
      refinement of behavioral interventions by providing information about feasibility, 
      acceptability, and potential efficacy. Despite their importance and wide-spread use, 
      the approaches taken by behavioral scientists to scale-up early-stage studies to 
      larger-scale trials has received little attention. The aim of our study was to 
      understand the role that pilot studies play in the development and execution of 
      larger-scale trials. METHODS: We conducted interviews with childhood obesity 
      researchers who had published pilot behavioral interventions and larger-scale trials 
      of the same or similar interventions. Questions were asked about the role of pilot 
      studies in developing larger-scale trials and the challenges encountered when 
      scaling-up an intervention based upon pilot findings. Data were coded and analyzed 
      using an inductive analytic approach to identify themes. RESULTS: Twenty-four 
      interventionists (54% women, 37-70 years old, mean 20 years since terminal degree) 
      completed a total of 148 pilot studies across their careers (mean 6.4, range 1-20), 
      of which 59% were scaled-up. Scaling was described as resource intensive and pilot 
      work was considered essential to successfully competing for funding by 63% of the 
      sample (n = 15). When asked to define a high-quality pilot study, interventionists 
      described studies that allowed them to evaluate two independent factors: components 
      of their intervention (e.g., acceptability, feasibility) and study parameters (e.g., 
      sample size, measures). Interventionists expressed that more process implementation 
      measures, different study designs, and additional iterations could improve decisions 
      to scale-up. Most agreed that pilot studies were likely to produce inflated 
      estimates of potential efficacy though only nine interventionists provided potential 
      solutions for decreasing inflated measures of efficacy. Suggested major causes of 
      inflated effects included high levels of oversight in pilot studies (e.g., 
      researcher support), reliance on subjective measures, and utilizing convenience or 
      highly motivated samples. Potential solutions included designing pilots for 
      real-world implementation, only conducting randomized controlled pilot studies, and 
      pre-registering pilot studies. CONCLUSIONS: Pilot studies purposes are multifaceted 
      and deemed essential to obtaining funding for larger-scale trials. Clarifying the 
      form and function of preliminary, early-stage research may enhance the productive 
      utilization of early-stage studies and reduced drops in efficacy when transitioning 
      to larger scale studies.

TI  - A scoping review of outcomes commonly reported in obesity prevention interventions 
      aiming to improve obesity-related health behaviors in children to age 5 years.
PG  - e13427
LID - 10.1111/obr.13427 [doi]
AB  - This scoping review was undertaken as the first stage of development of the Core 
      Outcome Sets for Early Prevention of Obesity in CHildhood (COS-EPOCH). The aim of 
      this review is to identify the outcomes collected and reported in randomized 
      controlled trials of early childhood obesity prevention interventions. A systematic 
      scoping review was undertaken following published guidelines. Trial registries and 
      Medline were searched, and records retrieved were screened by two reviewers. 
      Included trials aimed to prevent childhood obesity in the first 5 years of life and 
      were randomized. Data were extracted using a standardized form. Outcomes were 
      assigned to outcome domains, and similar definitions within each domain were merged, 
      based on key literature and expert consensus. Outcome and domain frequencies were 
      estimated and presented in outcome matrices. Eighteen outcome domains were 
      identified from 161 included studies: "anthropometry," "dietary intake," "physical 
      activity," "sedentary behaviour," "emotional functioning/wellbeing," "feeding," 
      "cognitive/executive functioning," "sleep," "other," "study-related," "parenting 
      practices," "motor skill development," "environmental," "blood and lymphatic 
      system," "perceptions and preferences," "quality of life," and "economic," "oral 
      health." The most frequently reported outcome domain was anthropometry (92% of 
      studies), followed by dietary intake (77%) and physical activity (60%). 221 unique 
      outcomes were identified, indicating a high degree of heterogeneity. Body mass index 
      was the only outcome reported in >50% of studies. The considerable heterogeneity in 
      outcomes supports the need for the development of COS-EPOCH.

TI  - Factors associated with mortality in hospitalized cardiovascular disease patients 
      infected with COVID-19.
LID - 10.1002/iid3.561 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To reduce mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD), it is necessary to understand the relationship between 
      patient's symptoms, risk factors, and comorbidities with their mortality rate. To 
      the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first which take into account the 
      determinants like risk factors, symptoms, and comorbidities leading to mortality in 
      CVD patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: This study was conducted 
      on 660 hospitalized patients with CVD and COVID-19 recruited between January 2020 
      and January 2021 in Iran. All patients were diagnosed with the previous history of 
      CVD like angina, myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, abnormal 
      heart rhythms, and congenital heart disease before they were hospitalized for 
      COVID-19. We collected data on patient's signs and symptoms, clinical and 
      paraclinical examinations, and any underlying comorbidities. t test was used to 
      determine the significant difference between the two deceased and alive groups. In 
      addition, the relation between pairs of symptoms and pairs of comorbidities has been 
      determined via correlation computation. RESULTS: Our findings suggest that signs and 
      symptoms such as fever, cough, myalgia, chest pain, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, 
      vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia had no impact on patients' mortality. There was a 
      significant correlation between COVID-19 cardiovascular patients' mortality rate and 
      symptoms such as headache, loss of consciousness (LOC), oxygen saturation less than 
      93%, and need for mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results might help 
      physicians identify early symptoms, comorbidities, and risk factors related to 
      mortality in CVD patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

TI  - Relative contributions of the nervous system, spinal tissue and psychosocial health 
      to non-specific low back pain: Multivariate meta-analysis.
PG  - 578-599
LID - 10.1002/ejp.1883 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Nervous system, psychosocial and spinal tissue biomarkers 
      are associated with non-specific low back pain (nsLBP), though relative 
      contributions are unclear. DATABASES AND DATA TREATMENT: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, 
      PsycINFO and SPORTDiscus were searched up to 25 March 2020. Related reviews and 
      reference lists were also screened. Observational studies examining structural and 
      functional nervous system biomarkers (e.g. quantitative sensory tests, structural 
      and functional brain measures), psychosocial factors (e.g. mental health, 
      catastrophizing) and structural spinal imaging biomarkers (e.g. intervertebral disc 
      degeneration, paraspinal muscle size) between nsLBP and pain-free controls were 
      included. For multivariate meta-analysis, two of three domains were required in each 
      study. Random-effects pairwise and multivariate meta-analyses were performed. GRADE 
      approach assessed evidence certainty. Newcastle-Ottawa scale assessed risk of bias. 
      Main outcomes were the effect size difference of domains between nsLBP and pain-free 
      controls. RESULTS: Of 4519 unique records identified, 33 studies (LBP = 1552, 
      referents = 1322) were meta-analysed. Psychosocial state (Hedges' g [95%CI]: 0.90 
      [0.69-1.10], p < 0.001) in nsLBP showed larger effect sizes than nervous system 
      (0.31 [0.13-0.49], p < 0.001; difference: 0.61 [0.36-0.86], p < 0.001) and spine 
      imaging biomarkers (0.55 [0.37-0.73], p < 0.001; difference: 0.36 [0.04-0.67], 
      p = 0.027). The relationship between domains changes depending on if pain duration 
      is acute or chronic. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial effect sizes in nsLBP are greater 
      than those for spinal imaging and nervous system biomarkers. Limitations include 
      cross-sectional design of studies included and inference of causality. Future 
      research should investigate the clinical relevance of these effect size differences 
      in relation to pain intensity and disability. STUDY REGISTRATION: 
      PROSPERO-CRD42020159188. SIGNIFICANCE: Spinal structural lesions (e.g. 
      intervertebral disc degeneration), psychosocial (e.g. depression) and nervous system 
      factors (detected by e.g. quantitative sensory tests, structural and functional 
      measures) contribute to non-specific low back pain. However, psychosocial factors 
      may be more compromised than nervous system and spinal imaging biomarkers. This 
      relationship depends on if the pain is acute or chronic. These findings underscore 
      that the 'non-specific' label in back pain should be reconsidered, and more specific 
      multidimensional categories evaluated to guide patient management.

TI  - The Effects of In Utero Fetal Hypoxia and Creatine Treatment on Mitochondrial 
      Function in the Late Gestation Fetal Sheep Brain.

AB  - Near-term acute hypoxia in utero can result in significant fetal brain injury, with 
      some brain regions more vulnerable than others. As mitochondrial dysfunction is an 
      underlying feature of the injury cascade following hypoxia, this study is aimed at 
      characterizing mitochondrial function at a region-specific level in the near-term 
      fetal brain after a period of acute hypoxia. We hypothesized that regional 
      differences in mitochondrial function would be evident, and that prophylactic 
      creatine treatment would mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction following hypoxia; 
      thereby reducing fetal brain injury. Pregnant Border-Leicester/Merino ewes with 
      singleton fetuses were surgically instrumented at 118 days of gestation (dGa; term 
      is ~145 dGA). A continuous infusion of either creatine (n = 15; 6 mg/kg/h) or 
      isovolumetric saline (n = 16; 1.5 ml/kg/h) was administered to the fetuses from 
      121 dGa. After 10 days of infusion, a subset of fetuses (8 saline-, 7 
      creatine-treated) were subjected to 10 minutes of umbilical cord occlusion (UCO) to 
      induce a mild global fetal hypoxia. At 72 hours after UCO, the fetal brain was 
      collected for high-resolution mitochondrial respirometry and molecular and 
      histological analyses. The results show that the transient UCO-induced acute hypoxia 
      impaired mitochondrial function in the hippocampus and the periventricular white 
      matter and increased the incidence of cell death in the hippocampus. Creatine 
      treatment did not rectify the changes in mitochondrial respiration associated with 
      hypoxia, but there was a negative relationship between cell death and creatine 
      content following treatment. Irrespective of UCO, creatine increased the proportion 
      of cytochrome c bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane, upregulated the mRNA 
      expression of the antiapoptotic gene Bcl2, and of PCG1-α, a driver of mitogenesis, 
      in the hippocampus. We conclude that creatine treatment prior to brief, acute 
      hypoxia does not fundamentally modify mitochondrial respiratory function, but may 
      improve mitochondrial structural integrity and potentially increase mitogenesis and 
      activity of antiapoptotic pathways.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Gait Retraining on Running Kinematics, Kinetics, Performance, 
      Pain, and Injury in Distance Runners: A Systematic Review With Meta-analysis.
PG  - 1-44
LID - 10.2519/jospt.2022.10585 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of running gait retraining on kinematics, 
      kinetics, performance, pain, and injury in distance runners. DESIGN: Intervention 
      systematic review with meta-analysis. LITERATURE SEARCH: Seven electronic databases 
      from inception to March 2021. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials 
      that (i) evaluated running gait retraining compared to no intervention, usual 
      training, placebo, or standard care, and (ii) reported biomechanical, physiological, 
      performance, or clinical outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS: Random-effects meta-analyses were 
      completed, and the certainty of evidence was judged using the GRADE criteria. We 
      categorised interventions into step-rate, non-rearfoot footstrike, impact, ground 
      contact time, and multi-parameter subgroups. RESULTS: We included 19 trials (673 
      participants). Moderate certainty evidence indicated step rate gait retraining 
      increased step rate (SMD 1.03 [95% CI: 0.63, 1.44]; number of trials (N): 4; I(2): 
      0%) and reduced average vertical loading rate (SMD -0.57 [95% CI: -1.05, -0.09], N: 
      3; I(2): 0%). Low certainty evidence indicated non-rearfoot footstrike retraining 
      increased knee flexion at initial contact (SMD 0.74 [95% CI: 0.11, 1.37]; N: 2; 
      I(2): 0%), but did not alter running economy (SMD 0.21 [95% CI: -1.11, 1.52]; N: 3; 
      I(2): 19%).). Low certainty evidence indicated multi-parameter retraining did not 
      alter running economy (SMD 0.32 [-0.39, 1.02]; N: 3; I(2): 19%) or performance (SMD 
      0.14 [95% CI: -4.87, 4.58]; N: 2; I(2): 18%). Insufficient trials reported on pain 
      outcomes. Two trials demonstrated reduced 1 year injury incidence following gait 
      retraining. CONCLUSIONS: Gait retraining interventions altered step rate and knee 
      kinematics, lowered vertical loading rates, and did not affect running performance.

TI  - Dark Green Leafy Vegetable Intake, MTHFR Genotype, and Risk of Cutaneous Squamous 
      Cell Carcinoma.
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1159/000520941 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that consumption of dark green leafy vegetables may 
      influence the decrease in the risk of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Dark 
      green leafy vegetables contain folate as a main component among other nutrients; 
      thus, we hypothesised that their possible observed protective effect on SCC, 
      observed in previous studies, would be more evident in persons with specific 
      genotypes related to folate metabolism. METHODS: Genotyping of 
      methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene variants rs1801133 (C677T) and 
      rs1801131 (A1298C) was carried out for 1,128 participants in an Australian 
      community-based longitudinal study of skin cancer. Dietary intakes were assessed 
      through repeated Food Frequency Questionnaires (1992-1996), and all incident skin 
      cancers were recorded in 1992-2007 and histologically confirmed. We assessed 
      associations between intake of dark green leafy vegetables and SCC development in 
      strata defined by genotype, by calculating relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence 
      intervals (CIs) using generalised linear models with negative binomial distribution 
      and person-years of follow-up as offset. RESULTS: High versus low intake of dark 
      green leafy vegetables was associated with a lower risk of SCC tumours in carriers 
      of the C677T variant allele (RR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.23-0.75), and within wild-type 
      A1298C homozygotes (RR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.22-0.85). CONCLUSION: The protective 
      effect of dark green leafy vegetables on cutaneous SCC may be genotype-dependent. 
      Folate metabolism-related gene polymorphisms should be considered when assessing the 
      relation of green leafy vegetables to cancer risk.

TI  - Sesamol Reverses Myofiber-Type Conversion in Obese States via Activating the 
      SIRT1/AMPK Signal Pathway.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.1c08036 [doi]
AB  - Obesity can evoke changes of skeletal muscle structure and function, which are 
      characterized by the conversion of myofiber from type I to type II, leading to a 
      vicious cycle of metabolic disorders. Reversing the muscle fiber-type conversion in 
      obese states is a novel strategy for treating those with obesity. Sesamol, a food 
      ingredient compound isolated from sesame seeds, exerted potential antiobesity 
      effects. The present research aimed to explore the therapeutic effects of sesamol on 
      obesity-related skeletal muscle-fiber-type conversion and elucidate the underlying 
      molecular mechanisms through utilizing a high-fat-diet-induced obese C57BL/6J mice 
      model and palmitic acid-exposed C2C12 myotubes. The results showed that sesamol 
      attenuated obesity-related metabolic disturbances, elevated exercise endurance of 
      obese mice, and decreased lipid accumulation and insulin resistance in skeletal 
      muscle. After the treatment with sesamol, the muscular mitochondrial content and 
      biogenesis were increased, accompanied by the enzyme activities and myosin 
      heavy-chain isoform changed from type II fiber to type I fiber. Mechanistic studies 
      revealed that the effects of sesamol on reversing skeletal muscle-fiber-type 
      conversion in obese states were associated with the stimulation of the muscular 
      sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signal pathway, and these 
      effects could be inhibited by a specific inhibitor of SIRT1, EX-527. In conclusion, 
      our research provided novel evidence that sesamol could regulate myofiber-type 
      conversion to treat obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorders by stimulating 
      the muscular SIRT1/AMPK signal pathway.

TI  - Residual force enhancement in human skeletal muscles: A systematic review and 
      meta-analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We reviewed and appraised the existing evidence of in vivo manifestations 
      of residual force enhancement in human skeletal muscles and assessed, through a 
      meta-analysis, the effect of an immediate history of eccentric contraction on the 
      subsequent torque capacity of voluntary and electrically evoked muscle contractions. 
      METHODS: Our search was conducted from database inception to May 2020. Descriptive 
      information was extracted from, and quality was assessed for, 45 studies. 
      Meta-analyses and metaregressions were used to analyze residual torque enhancement 
      and its dependence on the angular amplitude of the preceding eccentric contraction. 
      RESULTS: Procedures varied across studies with regards to muscle group tested, 
      angular stretch amplitude, randomization of contractions, time window analyzed, and 
      verbal command. Torque capacity in isometric (constant muscle tendon unit length and 
      joint angle) contractions preceded by an eccentric contraction was typically greater 
      compared to purely isometric contractions, and this effect was greater for 
      electrically evoked muscle contractions than voluntary contractions. Residual torque 
      enhancement differed across muscle groups for the voluntary contractions, with a 
      significant enhancement in torque observed for the adductor pollicis, ankle 
      dorsiflexors, ankle plantar flexors, and knee extensors, but not for the elbow and 
      knee flexors. Meta-regressions revealed that the angular amplitude of the eccentric 
      contraction (normalized to the respective joint's full range of motion) was not 
      associated with the residual torque enhancement observed. CONCLUSION: There is 
      evidence of residual torque enhancement for most, but not all, muscle groups, and 
      residual torque enhancement is greater for electrically evoked than for voluntary 
      contractions. Contrary to our hypothesis, and contrary to generally accepted 
      findings on isolated muscle preparations, residual torque enhancement in voluntary 
      and electrically evoked contractions does not seem to depend on the angular 
      amplitude of the preceding eccentric contraction.

TI  - Discovery of Urinary Biomarkers of Spinach Consumption Using Untargeted LC-MS 
      Metabolomics in a Human Intervention Trial.
PG  - e2100260
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.202100260 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: Biomarkers for intake of green leafy vegetables such as spinach can help 
      investigate their health effects. However, only few potential intake markers have 
      been reported in the literature so far. METHODS AND RESULTS: Based on a cross-over 
      study on whole leaf and minced spinach, we investigate changes in metabolites before 
      and after spinach intake and differences between the two treatments and health 
      status. Nineteen volunteers (12 healthy subjects and 7 short bowel patients) 
      completed the study within 48 days. Urine samples (24-h intervals before and after 
      spinach intake) and serum samples (baseline, post 8 d, and post 15 d) are collected 
      and analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole 
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS). The acquired data is analyzed by 
      multivariate and univariate analyses. Three candidate biomarkers are observed in 
      urine only after the spinach intake, including des-amino arginine pentenol ester, 
      D/L-malic acid ester of cis-p-coumarate, D/L-malic acid ester of trans-p-coumarate, 
      and 69 metabolites are present before spinach intake but showing an altered level 
      after treatment. These metabolites are related to dietary habits or meal structure, 
      and some changes are possibly affected by spinach intake. The candidate biomarkers 
      are independent of spinach pre-processing and healthy status. No markers are 
      discovered in serum samples. CONCLUSION: We propose structures for three candidate 
      spinach intake biomarkers; these markers will need further validation in independent 
      studies.

TI  - Digital storytelling within the Australian mining industry: worker engagement and 
      health literacy indicator effects.
LID - daab106 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/heapro/daab106 [doi]
AB  - The mining industry is a demanding context for workplace health education due to a 
      range of factors including productivity targets, workforce diversity and work roster 
      schedules. This project investigated the impact of digital story health 
      communication on worker engagement and its effect on interactive and critical health 
      literacy indicators. The study comprised a quasi-experimental parallel time series 
      research design, with control and intervention groups at each of the mine sites 
      (n = 2). Workers in the intervention group (n = 85) received a 'toolbox talk' 
      presentation incorporating a digital story featuring a mining industry worker and a 
      leading cardiovascular health expert. The control group (n = 90) received equivalent 
      health information communicated in a non-narrative manner, reflective of typical 
      practices within the mining industry. A significantly greater effect was evident for 
      worker engagement within the intervention group, with substantial maintenance over 
      the follow-up period, compared with no significant effect at follow-up within the 
      control group. Significant effects on interactive health literacy indicators (n = 3) 
      were evident for the intervention group with corresponding lower level or nil 
      effects within the control group. The findings highlight the benefits of 
      evidence-based digital stories as an efficient and efficacious worker-centred health 
      communication strategy for complex industrial workplace environments.

OAB - This quasi-experimental intervention study sought to test the effectiveness of 
      digital stories featuring mining workers and leading health experts as a workplace 
      health education strategy. The mining industry is a challenging setting for health 
      education due to a range of reasons including productivity targets, workforce 
      diversity and work roster schedules. Workers in the intervention group received a 
      ‘toolbox talk’ presentation including a digital story. Workers in the control group 
      received the same health information without the digital story, reflecting common 
      health communication practices in the industry. Outcomes of this research 
      demonstrate that digital storytelling was more effective on worker engagement and 
      interactive health literacy, with a promising level of maintenance over a follow-up 
      period. The findings show the benefits of digital storytelling as a worker focused 
      health education strategy for complex industrial settings where time efficient 
      communication methods are required.

TI  - Long-Term Combined Effects of Citrulline and Nitrate-Rich Beetroot Extract 
      Supplementation on Recovery Status in Trained Male Triathletes: A Randomized, 
      Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.3390/biology11010075 [doi]
LID - 75
AB  - Citrulline (CIT) and nitrate-rich beetroot extract (BR) are widely studied ergogenic 
      aids. Nevertheless, both supplements have been studied in short-term trials and 
      separately. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the effects of combining CIT and 
      BR supplementation on recovery status observed by distance covered in the Cooper 
      test, exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) and anabolic/catabolic hormone status 
      have not been investigated to date. Therefore, the main purpose of this research was 
      to assess the effect of the long-term (9 weeks) mixture of 3 g/day of CIT plus 2.1 
      g/day of BR (300 mg/day of nitrates (NO(3)(-))) supplementation on recovery by 
      distance covered in the Cooper test, EIMD markers (urea, creatinine, AST, ALT, GGT, 
      LDH and CK) and anabolic/catabolic hormones (testosterone, cortisol and 
      testosterone/cortisol ratio (T/C)) in male trained triathletes. Thirty-two 
      triathletes were randomized into four different groups of eight triathletes in this 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial: placebo group (PLG), CIT group (CITG; 3 
      g/day of CIT), BR group (BRG; 2.1 g/day of BR (300 mg/day of NO(3)(-))) and CIT-BR 
      group (CIT-BRG; 3 g/day of CIT plus 2.1 g/day of BR (300 mg/day of NO(3)(-))). 
      Distance covered in the Cooper test and blood samples were collected from all 
      participants at baseline (T1) and after 9 weeks of supplementation (T2). There were 
      no significant differences in the interaction between group and time in EIMD markers 
      (urea, creatinine, AST, ALT, GGT, LDH and CK) (p > 0.05). However, significant 
      differences were observed in the group-by-time interaction in distance covered in 
      the Cooper test (p = 0.002; η(2)p = 0.418), cortisol (p = 0.044; η(2)p = 0.247) and 
      T/C (p = 0.005; η(2)p = 0.359). Concretely, significant differences were observed in 
      distance covered in the Cooper test percentage of change (p = 0.002; η(2)p = 0.418) 
      between CIT-BRG and PLG and CITG, in cortisol percentage change (p = 0.049; η(2)p = 
      0.257) and in T/C percentage change (p = 0.018; η(2)p = 0.297) between CIT-BRG and 
      PLG. In conclusion, the combination of 3 g/day of CIT plus 2.1 g/day of BR (300 
      mg/day of NO(3)(-)) supplementation for 9 weeks did not present any benefit for 
      EIMD. However, CIT + BR improved recovery status by preventing an increase in 
      cortisol and showing an increase in distance covered in the Cooper test and T/C.

TI  - Plasma Glutathione and Prodromal Parkinson's Disease Probability.
PG  - 200-205
LID - 10.1002/mds.28826 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A decrease in glutathione (GSH) levels is considered one of the earliest 
      biochemical changes in Parkinson's disease (PD). OBJECTIVE: The authors explored the 
      potential role of plasma GSH as a risk/susceptibility biomarker for prodromal PD 
      (pPD) by examining its longitudinal associations with pPD probability trajectories. 
      METHODS: A total of 405 community-dwelling participants (median age [interquartile 
      range] = 73.2 [7.41] years) without clinical features of parkinsonism were followed 
      for a mean (standard deviation) of 3.0 (0.9) years. RESULTS: A 1 μmol/L increase in 
      plasma GSH was associated with 0.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.1%-0.7%; 
      P = 0.017) less increase in pPD probability for 1 year of follow-up. Compared with 
      participants in the lowest GSH tertile, participants in the highest GSH tertile had 
      a 12.9% (95% CI, 22.4%-2.2%; P = 0.020) slower rate of increase of pPD probability 
      for 1 year of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Plasma GSH was associated with pPD probability 
      trajectories; therefore, it might assist in the identification of individuals who 
      are likely to reach the threshold for pPD diagnosis more rapidly. © 2021

TI  - The Impact of Grounding in Running Shoes on Indices of Performance in Elite 
      Competitive Athletes.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19031317 [doi]
LID - 1317
AB  - The introduction of carbon fiber plate shoes has triggered a plethora of world 
      records in running, which has encouraged shoe industries to produce novel shoe 
      designs to enhance running performance, including shoes containing conductor 
      elements or "grounding shoes" (GS), which could potentially reduce the energy cost 
      of running. The aim of this study was to examine the physiological and perceptual 
      responses of athletes subjected to grounding shoes during running. Ten elite runners 
      were recruited. Firstly, the athletes performed an incremental running test for 
      VO(2)max and anaerobic threshold (AT) determination, and were familiarized with the 
      two shoe conditions (traditional training shoe (TTS) and GS, the latter containing a 
      conductor element under the insole). One week apart, athletes performed running 
      economy tests (20 min run at 80% of the AT) on a 400 m dirt track, with shoe 
      conditions randomized. VO(2), heart rate, lactate, and perceived fatigue were 
      registered throughout the experiment. No differences in any of the physiological or 
      perceptual variables were identified between shoe conditions, with an equal running 
      economy in both TTS and GS (51.1 ± 4.2 vs. 50.9 ± 5.1 mL kg(-1) min(-1), 
      respectively). Our results suggest that a grounding stimulus does not improve the 
      energy cost of running, or the physiological/perceptual responses of elite athletes.

TI  - The within- and between-day reliability of cerebrovascular reactivity using 
      traditional and novel analytical approaches.
PG  - 29-41
LID - 10.1113/EP090031 [doi]
AB  - NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of the study? What is the reliability of 
      middle cerebral artery velocity cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) when using 
      traditional and novel outcomes, as measured by transcranial Doppler? What is the 
      main finding and its importance? Traditional CVR approaches presented acceptable 
      reproducibility but should be expressed as an absolute CVR. Large within- and 
      between-individual differences in the middle cerebral artery velocity response 
      profile support using a dynamic peak, rather than a set time point, for the most 
      reliable interpretation. The study highlights the utility of novel kinetic CVR 
      outcomes, but due to increased variability in time-based metrics, this analysis 
      requires larger sample sizes than traditional methods. ABSTRACT: Cerebrovascular 
      reactivity (CVR) of middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv) to CO(2) is a common 
      method to assess cerebrovascular function. Yet, the approaches used to calculate CVR 
      outcomes vary. The aim of this study was to explore the within- and between-day 
      reliability of traditional CVR outcomes. The second aim was to explore the 
      reliability of novel kinetic-based analyses. Healthy adults (n = 10, 22.3 ± 
      3.4 years) completed assessments of CVR over 4 min using a fixed fraction of 
      inspired CO(2) (6%). This was repeated across four separate visits (between-day), 
      and on one visit measures were repeated 2.5 h later (within-day). No mean biases 
      were present between assessments for traditional CVR metrics, expressed as absolute 
      (cm/s/mmHg) or relative (%/mmHg) outcomes (minute 3, minute 4, peak 1 s, peak 30 s) 
      (between-day: P > 0.14, η(p) (2) < 0.20; within-day: P > 0.22, d > 0.27). Absolute, 
      rather than relative, CVR yielded the most reproducible parameters (coefficient of 
      variation: 8.1-13.2% vs. 14-83%, respectively). There were significant differences 
      between CVR outcomes (P < 0.001, η(p) (2) > 0.89) dependent on the time point used 
      to determine CVR, as a steady state MCAv response was rarely observed. Furthermore, 
      the MCAv response was not reproducible within an individual (κ = 0.15, P = 0.09). No 
      mean differences were present for novel kinetic outcomes (amplitude, time-delay, 
      time constant) (between-day: P > 0.05, d < 0.33; within-day: P > 0.38, d < 0.25). 
      The results support the need for standardisation and indicate CVR should be defined 
      as a dynamic peak, rather than a set time point for increased reliability. For novel 
      kinetic outcomes variability was greater (CV: 8.7-120.9%) due to the nature of 
      time-based metrics.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: More than half of Indian women of reproductive age are anemic. Regular 
      iron folic acid uptake can prevent and treat anemia. This study investigated the 
      effect of interpersonal communication on improving IFA use among women of 
      reproductive age. METHODS: The Reduction in Anemia through Normative Innovations 
      (RANI) Project is a cluster randomized trial that collected longitudinal data from 
      control (n = 1896) and intervention (n = 1898) communities in Odisha, India at Time 
      1 and six months later at Time 2. Structural equation models assessed the effect of 
      the intervention on iron folic acid use via multiple interpersonal communication 
      pathways. RESULTS: Compared to the control arm, iron folic acid use significantly 
      increased in the intervention arm. Both, general health interpersonal communication 
      and anemia-specific interpersonal communication were augmented in the intervention 
      communities. The impact of the intervention on iron folic acid use was mediated 
      through anemia-specific interpersonal communication. CONCLUSION: The RANI Project 
      increased interpersonal communication among participants, resulting in increased 
      iron folic acid use for anemia reduction. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Strategic use of 
      targeted interpersonal communication to promote behavior change appears to be a 
      viable strategy to increase iron folic acid use to reduce anemia.

TI  - Identifying aroma-active compounds in coffee-flavored dairy beverages.
LID - 10.1111/1750-3841.16071 [doi]
AB  - Coffee aroma is a complex mixture of volatile compounds. This study characterized 
      the important aroma-active compounds associated with consumer liking in formulated 
      coffee-flavored dairy beverages. Nine coffee-flavored dairy beverages were 
      formulated: low fat-low coffee; medium fat-low coffee; high fat-low coffee; low 
      fat-medium coffee; medium fat-medium coffee; high fat-medium coffee; low fat-high 
      coffee; medium fat-high coffee; and high fat-high coffee. Regular coffee consumers, 
      (n = 231) used a nine-point hedonic scale to rate acceptance of aroma. Volatile 
      compounds were extracted by head space-solid phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME) and 
      analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry (GC-MS-O) using a 
      modified frequency (MF) approach. Fifty-two aroma-active compounds were detected. 
      Thirty-one aroma-active compounds were considered important compounds with MF-value 
      ≥ 50%. The total number of aroma-active compounds and their intensity were affected 
      because of fat and coffee concentration. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was 
      performed to determine the relationship between aroma-active compounds and liking. 
      PLSR analysis identified three groups of compounds regarding liking. Twenty-five 
      compounds were associated with positive liking, for example, 
      2-(methylsulfanylmethyl) furan (coffee like). Sixteen compounds were negatively 
      associated with liking, for example, 2-methoxyphenol (bacon, medicine like). Eleven 
      detected compounds had no association with liking, for example, butane-2,3-dione 
      (butter, fruit like). Practical Application: The result of this study may be applied 
      to formulate coffee-flavored dairy beverages to maximize consumer acceptance and 
      aroma-liking. This study suggested too low coffee concentration is not desirable. 
      Too much fat affects aroma release and/or alters the characteristic coffee flavor 
      which negatively affects consumer acceptance.

TI  - Choice Bundling Increases Valuation of Delayed Losses More Than Gains in Cigarette 
      Smokers.
PG  - 796502
LID - 10.3389/fnbeh.2021.796502 [doi]
LID - 796502
AB  - Choice bundling, in which a single choice produces a series of repeating 
      consequences over time, increases valuation of delayed monetary and non-monetary 
      gains. Interventions derived from this manipulation may be an effective method for 
      mitigating the elevated delay discounting rates observed in cigarette smokers. No 
      prior work, however, has investigated whether the effects of choice bundling 
      generalize to reward losses. In the present study, an online panel of cigarette 
      smokers (N = 302), recruited using survey firms Ipsos and InnovateMR, completed 
      assessments for either monetary gains or losses (randomly assigned). In Step 1, 
      participants completed a delay-discounting task to establish Effective Delay 50 
      (ED50), or the delay required for an outcome to lose half of its value. In Step 2, 
      participants completed three conditions of an adjusting-amount task, choosing 
      between a smaller, sooner (SS) adjusting amount and a larger, later (LL) fixed 
      amount. The bundle size (i.e., number of consequences) was manipulated across 
      conditions, where a single choice produced either 1 (control), 3, or 9 consequences 
      over time (ascending/descending order counterbalanced). The delay to the first LL 
      amount in each condition, as well as the intervals between all additional SS and LL 
      amounts (where applicable), were set to individual participants' ED50 values from 
      Step 1 to control for differences in discounting of gains and losses. Results from 
      Step 1 showed significantly higher ED50 values (i.e., less discounting) for losses 
      compared to gains (p < 0.001). Results from Step 2 showed that choice bundling 
      significantly increased valuation of both LL gains and losses (p < 0.001), although 
      effects were significantly greater for losses (p < 0.01). Sensitivity analyses 
      replicated these conclusions. Future research should examine the potential clinical 
      utility of choice bundling, such as development of motivational interventions that 
      emphasize both the bundled health gains associated with smoking cessation and the 
      health losses associated with continued smoking.

TI  - The Acute Effects of Prolonged Uninterrupted Sitting on Vascular Function: A 
      Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 67-76
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000002763 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the dose-response relationship between 
      prolonged sitting and vascular function in healthy individuals and those with 
      metabolic disturbances and to investigate the acute effects, on vascular function, 
      of interventions that target interrupting prolonged sitting. DESIGN: This is a 
      systematic review with meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, 
      PubMed, and CINAHL were searched from inception to 4 December 2020. ELIGIBILITY 
      CRITERIA: Randomized crossover trials, quasi-randomized trials, and parallel group 
      trials where vascular function (flow-mediated dilation [FMD]) was assessed before 
      and after an acute period of sedentary behavior was used in this study. RESULTS: 
      Prolonged sitting resulted in a significant decrease in the standardized mean change 
      (SMC) for lower-limb FMD at the 120-min (SMC = -0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 
      -1.32 to -0.38) and 180-min (SMC = -1.18, 95% CI = -1.69 to -0.66) time points. A 
      similar pattern was observed for lower-limb shear rate. No significant changes were 
      observed for any outcomes in the upper limb. Subgroup analysis indicated that 
      prolonged sitting decreased lower-limb FMD in healthy adults (SMC = -1.33, 95% CI = 
      -1.89 to -0.78) who had higher a priori vascular endothelial function, but not in 
      those with metabolic and vascular dysfunction (SMC = -0.51, 95% CI = -1.18 to 0.15). 
      Interrupting sitting with active interruptions increased the standardized mean 
      difference for FMD, relative to prolonged sitting, but it was not statistically 
      significant (0.13, 95% CI = -0.20 to 0.45). CONCLUSIONS: Lower-limb vascular 
      function is progressively impaired as a consequence of prolonged sitting, up to 180 
      min. A similar trend was not observed in upper-limb vascular function. Subgroup 
      analysis indicated that prolonged sitting negatively affects healthy populations, a 
      finding not observed in those with metabolic disturbances. Regularly interrupting 
      sitting with activity may be beneficial for those with metabolic disturbances.

TI  - Increased short interval intracortical inhibition in participants with previous 
      hamstring strain injury.
PG  - 357-369
LID - 10.1007/s00421-021-04839-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cortical mechanisms may contribute to weakness in participants with 
      previous hamstring strain injury. This study aims to examine intra-cortical 
      inhibition (SICI) and corticospinal excitability in previously injured participants. 
      METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, TMS was used to examine SICI, silent period, 
      silent period: MEP ratios and area under the stimulus response curve in the biceps 
      femoris and medial hamstrings. Comparisons were made between participants with 
      (n = 10) and without (n = 10) previous hamstring strain injury. Motor threshold and 
      isometric knee flexor strength were also compared between participants and the 
      relationship between strength and SICI in control and previously injured 
      participants was examined. RESULTS: Isometric knee flexor strength was lower in 
      previously injured limbs compared with control limbs (mean difference = - 41 Nm 
      (- 26%) [95% CI = - 80 to - 2 Nm], p = 0.04, Cohen's d = - 1.27) and contralateral 
      uninjured limbs (mean difference = - 23 Nm (- 17%), [95% CI = - 40 to - 6 Nm], 
      p = 0.01, Cohen's d = - 0.57). Previously injured limbs exhibited smaller responses 
      to paired pulse stimulation (i.e. greater levels of SICI) in the biceps femoris 
      compared with control limbs (mean difference = - 19%, [95% CI = - 34 to - 5%], 
      p = 0.007, Cohen's d = - 1.33). Isometric knee flexor strength was associated with 
      the level of SICI recorded in the biceps femoris in previously injured participants 
      (coefficient = 23 Nm [95% CI = 7-40 Nm], adjusted R(2) = 0.31, p = 0.01). There were 
      no differences in markers of corticospinal excitability between previously injured 
      and control limbs (all p > 0.24, all Cohen's d < 0.40). CONCLUSION: Athletes with 
      previous injury in the biceps femoris exhibit increased SICI in this muscle compared 
      with control participants. Increased SICI is related to lower levels of hamstring 
      strength, and rehabilitation programs targeting the removal of intra-cortical 
      inhibition should be considered.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ultrasound inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter has been shown to decrease 
      in response to hemorrhage. IVC diameter cut points to identify moderate and severe 
      blood loss have not been established. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to find 
      ultrasound IVC diameter cut points to identify moderate and severe hemorrhage and 
      assess the performance of these cut points vs. vital sign abnormalities. METHODS: 
      This is a secondary analysis of data from a study that described changes in vital 
      signs and sonographic measurements of the IVC during a lower body negative pressure 
      model of hemorrhage. Using receiver operator curve analyses, optimal cut points for 
      identifying moderate and severe hemorrhage were identified. The ability of these cut 
      points to identify hemorrhage in patients with no vital sign abnormalities was then 
      assessed. RESULTS: In both long- and short-axis views, maximum and minimum IVC 
      diameters (IVC(max) and IVC(min)) were significantly lower than baseline in severe 
      blood loss. The optimal cut point for IVC(max) in both axes was found to be ≤ 0.8 
      cm. This cut point is able to distinguish between no blood loss vs. moderate blood 
      loss, and no blood loss vs. severe blood loss. The optimal cut point for IVC(min) 
      was variable between axes and blood loss severity. IVC diameter cut points obtained 
      were able to identify hemorrhage in patients with no vital sign abnormalities. 
      CONCLUSION: An ultrasound IVC(max) of ≤ 0.8 cm may be useful in identifying moderate 
      and severe hemorrhage before vital sign abnormalities are evident.

      spike-wave seizures.
LID - awac037 [pii]

AB  - Metabolism regulates neuronal activity and modulates the occurrence of epileptic 
      seizures. Here, using two rodent models of absence epilepsy, we show that 
      hypoglycemia increases the occurrence of spike-wave seizures. We then show that 
      selectively disrupting glycolysis in the thalamus, a structure implicated in absence 
      epilepsy, is sufficient to increase spike-wave seizures. We propose that activation 
      of thalamic AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a sensor of cellular energetic 
      stress and potentiator of metabotropic GABAB receptor function, is a significant 
      driver of hypoglycemia-induced spike-wave seizures. We show that AMPK augments 
      postsynaptic GABAB receptor-mediated currents in thalamocortical neurons and 
      strengthens epileptiform network activity evoked in thalamic brain slices. Selective 
      thalamic AMPK activation also increases spike-wave seizures. Finally, systemic 
      administration of metformin, an AMPK agonist and common diabetes treatment, 
      profoundly increased spike-wave seizures. These results advance the decades-old 
      observation that glucose metabolism regulates thalamocortical circuit excitability 
      by demonstrating that AMPK and GABAB receptor cooperativity is sufficient to provoke 
      spike-wave seizures.

AB  - Dietary nitrate (NO(3)(-)) ingestion can be beneficial for health and exercise 
      performance. Recently, based on animal and limited human studies, a skeletal muscle 
      NO(3)(-) reservoir has been suggested to be important in whole body nitric oxide 
      (NO) homeostasis. The purpose of this study was to determine the time course of 
      changes in human skeletal muscle NO(3)(-) concentration ([NO(3)(-)]) following the 
      ingestion of dietary NO(3)(-). Sixteen participants were allocated to either an 
      experimental group (NIT: n = 11) which consumed a bolus of ∼1300 mg (12.8 mmol) 
      potassium nitrate (KNO(3)), or a placebo group (PLA: n = 5) which consumed a bolus 
      of potassium chloride (KCl). Biological samples (muscle (vastus lateralis), blood, 
      saliva and urine) were collected shortly before NIT or PLA ingestion and at 
      intervals over the course of the subsequent 24 h. At baseline, no differences were 
      observed for muscle [NO(3)(-)] and [NO(2)(-)] between NIT and PLA (P > 0.05). In 
      PLA, there were no changes in muscle [NO(3)(-)] or [NO(2)(-)] over time. In NIT, 
      muscle [NO(3)(-)] was significantly elevated above baseline (54 ± 29 nmol/g) at 
      0.5 h, reached a peak at 3 h (181 ± 128 nmol/g), and was not different to baseline 
      from 9 h onwards (P > 0.05). Muscle [NO(2)(-)] did not change significantly over 
      time. Following ingestion of a bolus of dietary NO(3)(-), skeletal muscle [NO(3)(-)] 
      increases rapidly, reaches a peak at ∼3 h and subsequently declines towards baseline 
      values. Following dietary NO(3)(-) ingestion, human m. vastus lateralis [NO(3)(-)] 
      expressed a slightly delayed pharmacokinetic profile compared to plasma [NO(3)(-)].

TI  - Internet Search Results for Older Adult Physical Activity Guidelines: Scoping 
      Review.
PG  - e29153
LID - 10.2196/29153 [doi]
LID - e29153
AB  - BACKGROUND: Older adults seek health-related information through casual internet 
      searches. Yet, researchers focus on peer-reviewed journals and conference 
      presentations as primary dissemination strategies. Representatives of mass media are 
      alerted (passive diffusion) of new studies or recommendations, but the veracity of 
      the information shared is not often analyzed, and when it is, the analysis is often 
      not comprehensive. However, most older adults do not have access to peer-reviewed 
      journal articles or paid subscription services for more reputable media outlets. 
      OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine what information was readily available (ie, open 
      access) to older adults who may casually search the internet for physical activity 
      recommendations. METHODS: We performed a 6-part scoping review to determine the 
      research question and available evidence, and extract data within open-access top 
      hits using popular online search engines. Results were categorized by a 
      dissemination model that has categories of sources, channels, audience, and 
      messages. RESULTS: After the iterative search process, 92 unique articles were 
      included and coded. Only 5 (5%) cited physical activity guidelines, and most were 
      coded as promoting healthy aging (82/92, 89%) and positive framing (84/92, 91%). 
      Most articles were posed as educational, but the authors' credentials were rarely 
      reported (ie, 22% of the time). Muscle strengthening and balance components of the 
      physical activity guidelines for older adults were rarely reported (72/92, 78% and 
      80/92, 87%, respectively) or inaccurately reported (3/92, 3% and 3/92, 3%, 
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Inconsistent messages lead to mistrust of science and 
      public health representatives. This work highlights the lack of evidence within 
      existing open-access resources. Further efforts are needed to ensure evidence-based 
      public health messages are in the sources and channels older adults are using to 
      inform their knowledge and behaviors.

TI  - Improvement in postural alignment is associated with recovery of mobility after 
      complex acquired brain injury: An observational study.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1080/09593985.2022.2034197 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Determine how mobility changes over 6 months in people unable to walk at 
      8-weeks post-Acquired Brain Injury (ABI); if there is an association over time 
      between postural alignment and mobility post-ABI; and if alignment after ABI becomes 
      closer to healthy alignment over time. METHODS: Fourteen adults with ABI, evaluated 
      over 6 months, and a reference sample of 30 healthy adults were studied. The primary 
      measure for changes in mobility was the Clinical Outcome Variables Scale (COVS). 
      Secondary measures were sit-to-stand, timed standing holding rails, independent 
      walking speed and number of testing conditions achieved. The Functional Independence 
      Measure (FIM) was scored at rehabilitation admission and discharge. To analyze 
      postural alignment, participants were recorded in sitting and standing, each 
      repeated holding rails, and walking if able. Three-dimensional kinematic data were 
      used to quantify whole-body postural alignment, equal to mean segment displacements 
      from the base of support in the transverse plane. Associations between 
      three-dimensional kinematic alignment scores and COVS scores were calculated using 
      Linear Mixed-Effects Models. RESULTS: Participants made significant improvements in 
      COVS scores, most secondary mobility scores, and FIM scores over time (p ≤ .001). 
      Relationships between increasing COVS scores and decreasing sitting and standing 
      mal-alignment scores were statistically significant. Visual analysis of graphed 
      segment positions indicated that sitting and standing alignment became more similar 
      to healthy alignment over time; this was not clear for walking. CONCLUSION: 
      Improvement in postural alignment may be a factor for improving mobility in people 
      with severe impairments after ABI.

TI  - Changes in adipose tissue microRNA expression across the menstrual cycle in 
      regularly menstruating females: a pilot study.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1152/physiolgenomics.00088.2021 [doi]
AB  - Cyclical changes in hormone profiles across the menstrual cycle are associated with 
      alterations in metabolic control. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to regulating 
      metabolic control, including adipose tissue metabolism. How fluctuations in hormonal 
      profiles across the menstrual cycle affect adipose tissue miRNA expression remains 
      unknown. Eleven healthy, regularly menstruating females underwent four sampling 
      visits across their menstrual cycle. Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue and 
      venous blood samples were collected at each sampling visit. Luteinizing hormone (LH) 
      tests, calendar counting, and serum hormone concentrations were used to determine 
      menstrual cycle phases: early-follicular (EF), late-follicular (LF), postovulatory 
      (PO), and midluteal (ML). Serum follicle-stimulating hormone, LH, estrogen, 
      progesterone, and testosterone were determined using multiplex magnetic bead panels 
      and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Global adipose tissue miRNA expression 
      levels were determined via microarray in a subset of participants (n = 8) and 17 
      candidate miRNAs were validated by RT-qPCR in the whole cohort (n = 11). Global 
      analysis of adipose tissue miRNA expression identified 33 miRNAs significantly 
      altered across the menstrual cycle; however, no significant differences remained 
      after correcting for multiple testing (P > 0.05). RT-qPCR analysis of candidate 
      miRNAs revealed miR-497-5p expression was significantly altered across the menstrual 
      cycle ([Formula: see text] = 0.18, P = 0.03); however, post hoc tests did not reveal 
      any significant differences between menstrual cycle phases (P > 0.05). miR-30c-5p 
      was associated with testosterone concentration (R(2) = 0.13, P = 0.033). These pilot 
      data indicate differences in adipose tissue miRNAs in healthy women across the 
      menstrual cycle and a weak association with ovarian hormones. Further research in 
      larger sample sizes is required to confirm regulation of miRNA expression across the 
      menstrual cycle.

TI  - Physical activity and adiposity in preschool children: The Barwon Infant Study.
PG  - e12853
LID - 10.1111/ijpo.12853 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The association between physical activity and adiposity in 
      preschool-aged children is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cross-sectional 
      association between objectively measured physical activity and body fat in 
      preschool-aged children. METHODS: In the preschool review in an Australian birth 
      cohort study (n = 1074), mean duration and time accumulated in ≥1-min bouts of 
      physical activity at light-intensity (LPA), moderate- to vigorous-intensity (MVPA) 
      and light- to vigorous-intensity (LMVPA) were computed from accelerometer (ActiGraph 
      GT3X+) data. Percent body fat was assessed by bioelectrical impedance. Associations 
      between physical activity and percent body fat were examined by multiple regression, 
      adjusted for accelerometer wear time, MVPA (in analyses of LPA), maternal body mass 
      index (BMI) and maternal education. RESULTS: A total of 450 participants (n = 450) 
      had valid data. There was evidence of associations between physical activity and 
      adiposity: each additional hour of LVPA was associated with 0.6% (CI(95) -0.2%, 
      1.3%) higher body fat; ≥1-min bouts of LPA was associated with 1.0% (CI(95) 0.1%, 
      1.9%) higher body fat; each additional hour of MVPA was associated with -0.8% 
      (CI(95) -1.6%, -0.1%) less body fat; and ≥1-min bouts of MVPA was associated with 
      -1.3% (CI(95) -2.5%, -0.1%) body fat. CONCLUSIONS: Among a cohort of preschool-aged 
      children, there was evidence that more intensive physical activity assessed by an 
      accelerometer is associated with reduced body fat.

      composition and muscular performance.

AB  - Human skeletal muscle fiber is heterogenous due to its diversity of slow- and 
      fast-twitch fibers. In human, slow-twitched fiber gene expression is correlated to 
      MOTS-c, a mitochondria-derived peptide that has been characterized as an exercise 
      mimetic. Within the MOTS-c open reading frame, there is an East Asian-specific 
      m.1382A>C polymorphism (rs111033358) that changes the 14th amino acid of MOTS-c 
      (i.e., K14Q), a variant of MOTS-c that has less biological activity. Here, we 
      examined the influence of the m.1382A>C polymorphism causing MOTS-c K14Q on skeletal 
      muscle fiber composition and physical performance. The myosin heavy chain (MHC) 
      isoforms (MHC-I, MHC-IIa, and MHC-IIx) as an indicator of muscle fiber composition 
      were assessed in 211 Japanese healthy individuals (102 men and 109 women). Muscular 
      strength was measured in 86 physically active young Japanese men by using an 
      isokinetic dynamometer. The allele frequency of the m.1382A>C polymorphism was 
      assessed in 721 Japanese athletes and 873 ethnicity-matched controls. The m.1382A>C 
      polymorphism genotype was analyzed by TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. Individuals with 
      the C allele of the m.1382A>C exhibited a higher proportion of MHC-IIx, an index of 
      fast-twitched fiber, than the A allele carriers. Men with the C allele of m.1382A>C 
      exhibited significantly higher peak torques of leg flexion and extension. 
      Furthermore, the C allele frequency was higher in the order of sprint/power athletes 
      (6.5%), controls (5.1%), and endurance athletes (2.9%). Additionally, young male 
      mice were injected with the MOTS-c neutralizing antibody once a week for four weeks 
      to mimic the C allele of the m.1382A>C and assessed for protein expression levels of 
      MHC-fast and MHC-slow. Mice injected with MOTS-c neutralizing antibody showed a 
      higher expression of MHC-fast than the control mice. These results suggest that the 
      C allele of the East Asian-specific m.1382A>C polymorphism leads to the MOTS-c K14Q 
      contributes to the sprint/power performance through regulating skeletal muscle fiber 
      composition.

TI  - Are Peripheral Biomarkers Determinants of Eating Styles in Childhood and Adolescence 
      Obesity? A Cross-Sectional Study.
LID - 10.3390/nu14020305 [doi]
LID - 305
AB  - Disturbances in eating behaviors have been widely related to obesity. However, 
      little is known about the role of obesity-related biomarkers in shaping habitual 
      patterns of eating behaviors (i.e., eating styles) in childhood. The objective of 
      the present study was to explore the relationships between several biomarkers 
      crucially involved in obesity (ghrelin, insulin resistance, and leptin/adiponectin 
      ratio) and eating styles in children and adolescents with obesity. Seventy 
      participants aged between 8 and 16 (56.2% men) fulfilled the Spanish version of the 
      Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire for Children to measure external, emotional, and 
      restrained eating styles. In addition, concentrations of ghrelin, leptin, 
      adiponectin, insulin, and glucose were obtained through a blood test. Hierarchical 
      multiple regression analyses controlling for age and sex were computed for each 
      eating style. Results indicated that individuals with higher ghrelin concentration 
      levels showed lower scores in restrained eating (β = -0.61, p < 0.001). The total 
      model explained 32% of the variance of the restrained pattern. No other 
      relationships between obesity-related biomarkers and eating behaviors were found. 
      This study highlights that one of the obesity-risk factors, namely lower plasma 
      ghrelin levels, is substantially involved in a well-known maladaptive eating style, 
      restraint eating, in childhood obesity.

TI  - Fat-free/lean body mass in children with insulin resistance or metabolic syndrome: a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 58

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lean / Fat Free Body Mass (LBM) is metabolically involved in active 
      processes such as resting energy expenditure, glucose uptake, and myokine secretion. 
      Nonetheless, its association with insulin sensitivity / resistance / glucose 
      tolerance and metabolic syndrome remains unclear in childhood. METHODS: The current 
      investigation aimed to examine the differences in fat-free mass /lean body mass 
      according to the presence of insulin sensitivity/insulin resistance/glucose 
      tolerance/metabolic syndrome in children. A systematic search was carried out in 
      Medline/PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and SciELO, covering the period from 
      each database's respective start to 21 June 2021. Two researchers evaluated 7111 
      studies according to the inclusion criteria: original human studies, written in 
      English or Spanish, evaluating fat-free mass/lean body mass in children and 
      adolescents including both with and without insulin sensitivity/insulin resistance 
      /glucose tolerance and metabolic syndrome and reported the differences between them 
      in terms of fat free mass/lean body mass. The results of the studies were combined 
      with insulin sensitivity, insulin, resistance, glucose tolerance and metabolic 
      syndrome. The standardized mean difference (SMD) in each study was calculated and 
      combined using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity between studies was tested 
      using the index of heterogeneity (I(2)), leave-one-out sensitivity analyses were 
      performed, and publication bias was assessed using the Egger and Begg tests. 
      RESULTS: Finally, 15 studies which compared groups defined according to different 
      glucose homeostasis criteria or metabolic syndrome out of 103 eligible studies were 
      included in this systematic review and 12 studies in the meta-analysis. 
      Meta-analysis showed lower fat-free mass/lean body mass percentage in participants 
      with insulin resistance/glucose tolerance/metabolic syndrome (SMD -0.47; 95% CI, 
      - 0.62 to - 0.32) while in mass units (kg), higher values were found in the same 
      group (SMD, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.60). CONCLUSIONS: Our results identified lower 
      values of fat-free mass/lean body mass (%) in children and adolescents with insulin 
      resistance/glucose tolerance/metabolic syndrome and higher values of fat-free 
      mass/lean body mass when these are expressed in kg. The evidence of the impact of 
      lean mass on children's glucose homeostasis or metabolic syndrome is limited, so 
      future studies research should focus on explaining the effect of fat-free mass/lean 
      body mass on different metabolic outcomes. Moreover, it may be interesting to 
      evaluate the quality (muscle density) or functional (muscle strength) outcomes in 
      addition to both absolute (kg) and relative (%) values in future studies. The 
      systematic review was prospectively registered at PROSPERO (registration number 
      CRD42019124734; available at: http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero [accessed: 05 April

TI  - Percentage of Age-Predicted Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Risk of Incident 
      Hypertension: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY.
LID - 10.1097/HCR.0000000000000672 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: There are inverse and independent associations between cardiorespiratory 
      fitness (CRF) and several adverse cardiometabolic outcomes including hypertension 
      (HTN). The prospective relationship between percentage of age-predicted CRF and risk 
      of HTN has not been previously investigated. We aimed to assess the association of 
      percentage of age-predicted CRF with incident HTN in a long-term prospective cohort 
      study. METHODS: Cardiorespiratory fitness, as measured by peak oxygen uptake, was 
      assessed using the gold standard respiratory gas exchange analyzer in 1602 men who 
      underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing. The age-predicted CRF estimated from a 
      regression equation for age was converted to percentage of age-predicted CRF 
      ([achieved CRF/age-predicted CRF] × 100). The HR with 95% CI were estimated for HTN. 
      RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 26.8 yr, 308 HTN cases were recorded. There 
      was a linear relationship between age-predicted CRF and incident HTN (P value for 
      nonlinearity = .68). A 1-SD increase in percentage of age-predicted CRF was 
      associated with a decreased risk of HTN in analysis adjusted for established risk 
      factors (HR = 0.79: 95% CI, 0.69-0.90), which remained consistent on further 
      adjustment for several other potential confounders including alcohol consumption, 
      physical activity, socioeconomic status, and inflammation (HR = 0.83: 95% CI, 
      0.72-0.95). The corresponding adjusted HRs were 0.55 (95% CI, 0.38-0.80) and 0.63 
      (95% CI, 0.43-0.91), respectively, when comparing extreme quartiles of percentage of 
      age-predicted CRF levels. CONCLUSIONS: Percentage of age-predicted CRF is linearly, 
      inversely, and independently associated with risk of incident HTN, and it is 
      comparable to absolute CRF as a risk indicator for HTN in a general population of 
      middle-aged men.

TI  - An Association between Bioavailable 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and Bone Mineral Density in 
      a Diverse Cohort of Collegiate Athletes.
PG  - 371-376
LID - 10.1249/MSS.0000000000002807 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although vitamin D is intimately involved in bone metabolism, the 
      relationship between vitamin D status, as measured by serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin 
      D [25(OH)D] concentration, and bone mineral density (BMD) is weak, particularly in 
      non-White populations. Measurement of bioavailable 25(OH)D has been suggested as a 
      better indicator of vitamin D status than total 25(OH)D concentration. To date, the 
      bioavailable 25(OH)D biomarker has been explored minimally in athletic populations. 
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between total and 
      bioavailable 25(OH)D concentrations and BMD in collegiate athletes. METHODS: NCAA 
      Division I basketball and swimming athletes served as study participants (n = 53; 28 
      females, 25 males; 28 basketball players, 25 swimmers). All participants completed 
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans for analysis of BMD, blood draws for vitamin 
      D measures, and diet/lifestyle questionnaires. RESULTS: Overall, total 25(OH)D was 
      80.0 + 13.9 nmol·L-1 and bioavailable 25(OH)D was 6.0 ± 1.9 nmol·L-1. There was 
      strong disagreement between total 25(OH)D and bioavailable 25(OH)D concentrations (κ 
      = -0.299, r = -0.129) (P = 0.100); 53% of total participants and 77% of Black 
      participants were classified differently (low vs normal vitamin D status) based on 
      total and bioavailable 25(OH)D criteria. Black participants had significantly lower 
      total 25(OH)D and higher bioavailable 25(OH)D concentrations than White participants 
      (59.5 vs 102.5 nmol·L-1 and 7.9 vs 5.4 nmol·L-1, respectively) (P < 0.001). Total 
      25(OH)D and total BMD were not correlated, but bioavailable 25(OH)D and total BMD 
      demonstrated a positive correlation (r = 0.618, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results suggest that bioavailable 25(OH)D concentration may be a better clinical 
      measure of vitamin D status than total 25(OH)D as related to BMD in collegiate 
      athletes, particularly in Black athletes. Further research on the utility of the 
      bioavailable 25(OH)D biomarker in athletes is needed.

      association between major dietary patterns and different metabolic phenotypes 
      (metabolically healthy non-obese [MHNO], metabolically unhealthy non-obese [MUNO], 
      metabolically healthy obese [MHO], and metabolically unhealthy obese [MUO]) in 
      middle-aged and elderly Japanese adults. This cross-sectional study enrolled 2,170 
      Japanese adults aged ≥40 years. The four different metabolic phenotypes were 
      determined based on the presence of obesity, abdominal obesity, hypertension, 
      hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia. The major dietary patterns were determined using 
      principal component analysis based on energy-adjusted food intake. Two dietary 
      patterns were identified: the healthy dietary pattern, which was characterized by a 
      high intake of vegetables, fruits, potatoes, soy products, mushrooms, seaweeds, and 
      fish; and the alcohol dietary pattern, which was characterized by a high intake of 
      alcoholic beverages, liver, chicken, and fish. The healthy dietary pattern was 
      associated with the MHNO and MHO phenotypes (MUNO and MUO as reference groups, 
      respectively), and the multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence 
      intervals [CIs]) in the highest quartile of healthy dietary pattern score with the 
      lowest quartile as the reference category were 2.10 (1.40-3.15) and 1.86 
      (1.06-3.25), respectively. Conversely, the alcohol dietary pattern was inversely 
      associated with the MHNO and MHO phenotypes, while the multivariate-adjusted ORs 
      (95% CIs) in the highest quartile of the alcohol dietary pattern score with the 
      lowest quartile as the reference category were 0.63 (0.42-0.94) and 0.45 
      (0.26-0.76), respectively. There were no significant interactions between sex and 
      healthy/alcohol dietary patterns in the prevalence of the MHNO and MHO phenotypes. 
      In conclusion, the present study's findings suggest that major dietary patterns are 
      associated with different metabolic phenotypes in middle-aged and elderly Japanese 
      adults. These findings provide useful evidence for maintaining metabolic health 
      through diet regardless of obesity status.

AB  - Metabolism has a role in determining the time of pubertal development and fertility. 
      Nonetheless, molecular/cellular pathways linking metabolism/body weight to 
      puberty/reproduction are unknown. The KNDy (Kisspeptin/Neurokinin B/Dynorphin) 
      neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus constitute the GnRH 
      (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) pulse generator. We previously created a mouse 
      model with a whole-body targeted deletion of nescient helix-loop-helix 2 (Nhlh2; 
      N2KO), a class II member of the basic helix-loop-helix family of transcription 
      factors. As this mouse model features pubertal failure and late-onset obesity, we 
      wanted to study whether NHLH2 represents a candidate molecule to link metabolism and 
      puberty in the hypothalamus. Exome sequencing of a large Idiopathic Hypogonadotropic 
      Hypogonadism cohort revealed obese patients with rare sequence variants in NHLH2, 
      which were characterized by in-silico protein analysis, chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter assays. In vitro heterologous 
      expression studies demonstrated that the variant p.R79C impairs Nhlh2 binding to the 
      Mc4r promoter. Furthermore, p.R79C and other variants show impaired transactivation 
      of the human KISS1 promoter. These are the first inactivating human variants that 
      support NHLH2's critical role in human puberty and body weight control. Failure to 
      carry out this function results in the absence of pubertal development and 
      late-onset obesity in humans.

TI  - Glucose Awareness to Motivate and Enable Solutions (GAMES) in diabetes mellitus 
      using flash glucose monitoring: A clinical programme.
PG  - e14733
LID - 10.1111/dme.14733 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This real-world observational clinical programme evaluated short and 
      medium-term effects of intermittent flash glucose monitoring on HbA1c, glycaemic 
      variability and lifestyle behavioural changes. METHODS: Two first-generation Libre 
      flash glucose monitoring sensors were provided 3-4 months apart with a food, 
      activity diary, user evaluation survey and treatment modification after each sensor 
      wear. T-tests were used to compare glucose variables within each sensor (week 1 vs. 
      week 2) and between sensors (1st sensor vs. 2nd sensor). EasyGV software was used to 
      calculate glycaemic variability. RESULTS: From 42 type 1 diabetes and 120 type 2 
      diabetes participants, there was no statistically significant change in mean HbA1c 
      for participants with type 1 diabetes at 3-4 months after the 1st sensor but there 
      was a statistically significant HbA1c reduction for participants with type 2 
      diabetes [-4 mmol/mol (-0.4%), p = 0.008], despite no statistically significant 
      differences in carbohydrate intake, exercise frequency and duration. Greater 
      reduction was seen in those with baseline HbA1c> 86 mmol/mol (10%) in both type 1 
      [-12 mmol/mol (-1.1%), p = 0.009] and type 2 diabetes [-11 mmol/mol (-1.0%), 
      p = 0.001). Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes showed improvements in Glucose 
      Management Indicator and percentage time-above-range when comparing week 1 versus 
      week 2 of the same sensor. Higher scan frequency resulted in improved glycaemic 
      parameters and certain measures of glycaemic variability. The majority of 
      participants (85%) agreed that flash glucose monitoring is a useful device but only 
      60% were keen to use it for daily monitoring. CONCLUSION: Constant feedback from 
      flash glucose monitoring improves glycaemic parameters within the first week of 
      wear. Intermittent use 3-4 months apart resulted in greater improvements for those 
      with higher baseline HbA1c.

TI  - Physique at Birth and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in Japanese Urban 
      Residents: the KOBE Study.
PG  - 188-199
LID - 10.5551/jat.61069 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study investigated the relationship between birth physique and 
      cardiovascular risk factors in Japanese urban residents aged 40 years and more. 
      METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire on birth physique was performed among 624 
      individuals (165 men and 459 women) who participated in the KOBE study. We examined 
      whether self-reported birth physique and available recorded birth weights matched 
      for 72 participants. Then the association between birth physique and risk factors 
      for all participants was examined by gender. Body size at birth in the questionnaire 
      (large, medium, small) was set as an exposure and laboratory values from the 
      baseline survey (2010-2011) were used as outcomes. RESULTS: Mean (standard 
      deviation) recorded birth weight of 72 participants was 3665 (318), 3051 (300), and 
      2653 (199) g, in the large, medium, and small group, respectively. In the analysis 
      for all participants, odds ratio for having both hypertension and impaired glucose 
      tolerance were significantly higher in the small versus large birth weight group, 
      which was 7.42 (95% CI 1.75-31.50) for men and 4.44 (95% CI 1.14-17.30) for women 
      after adjusting for age, body mass index, smoking/alcohol/exercise habits, and 
      menstrual status in women. Similar results were observed in participants with 
      recorded birth weight. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that individuals 
      with small physique at birth might be at higher risk for hypertension and impaired 
      glucose tolerance in middle age compared to those with large birth weight.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is increasing recognition that a morning or evening preference is 
      associated with time of eating, metabolic health, and morbidity. However, few 
      studies have examined the association of time of eating with mortality. OBJECTIVES: 
      To examine the association of time of first recalled ingestive episode with the 
      prospective risk of all-cause mortality. METHODS: We used mortality-linked data from 
      the NHANES conducted in 1988-1994 and 1999-2014 (n = 34,609; age ≥ 40 years). The 
      exposure was quartiles (Q1-Q4) of clock time of first eating episode self-reported 
      in the baseline 24-hour dietary recall. The outcome was follow-up time from the date 
      of NHANES examination to the date of death or end of the follow-up period (31 
      December 2015). We used proportional hazards regression methods to determine the 
      independent association of time of first eating episode with relative hazard of 
      all-cause mortality, with adjustments for multiple covariates and the complex survey 
      design. Multiple linear regression methods were used to examine the associations of 
      time of first eating episode with baseline cardiometabolic biomarkers and dietary 
      attributes. RESULTS: In this national cohort, with a median age of ∼55 years (95% 
      CI: 54.6-55.4 years) at baseline and a median follow-up of 8.3 years (IQR, 8.75 
      years), there were 10,303 deaths. The median times of first eating episodes in Q1-Q4 
      were 05:45, 07:00, 08:00, and 10:00, respectively. Covariate-adjusted relative 
      hazards of mortality in Q1 to Q3 of the time of the first eating episode were 0.88 
      (95% CI: 0.81-0.96), 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81-0.95), 0.94 (95% CI: 0.87-1.02), with Q4 as 
      the referent (P = 0.0008). Qualitative dietary attributes were inversely related 
      with the time of the first eating episode; however, BMI and serum concentrations of 
      glycemic biomarkers increased with later times of first eating episode (P ≤ 0.0001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Recall of an earlier time of the first eating episode by ≥40-year-old 
      US participants was suggestive of a small relative survival advantage in this 
      observational study.

AB  - Nowadays people use screens, such as mobile phones, television, or tablets, more 
      often during mealtimes, which may have an effect on intake. This review aims to 
      analyze the effect of screen use, during food consumption, on intake. A systematic 
      review was carried out, based on those protocols established by PRISMA. The Cochrane 
      Library, PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases were consulted. Experimental 
      studies, published between 2010 and 2021, that recorded individual intake while 
      using screens such as television, cell phones, or tablets, were selected. A total of 
      7181 relevant articles were obtained, which were then assessed in accordance with 
      predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, 35 studies were included in 
      the complete review: 22 compared different kinds of television content (e.g., 
      adverts), five which compared television versus the absence of screens, four which 
      compared television versus video games, two which compared the use of simultaneous 
      screens, and two studies which included cell phones. A total of 27 studies reported 
      consumption increases related to the presence of advertisements and food signals on 
      screens. No significant differences in intake were reported in the eight studies 
      that reported design or sample size limitations, or lack of control of certain 
      variables. It is thus concluded that screen use during food consumption may increase 
      intake. Education is necessary to regulate the habit of consuming food in the 
      presence of screens. Also, the creation of policies that regulate advertising and 
      food cues on screens are justified and must be accompanied by strategies to monitor 
      compliance. As a limitation, further evidence is necessary in order to determine the 
      effect of mobile phone and tablet use while eating. This protocol was registered via 
      PROSPERO, ID: CRD42020211797.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ability to form enduring social bonds is characteristic of human 
      nature, and impairments in social affiliation are central features of severe 
      neuropsychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. 
      Owing to its ability to form long-term pair-bonds, the socially monogamous prairie 
      vole has emerged as an excellent model to study the neurobiology of social 
      attachment. Despite the enduring nature of the bond, however, surprisingly few genes 
      have been implicated in the pair-bonding process in either sex. METHODS: Male and 
      female prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) were cohabitated with an opposite-sex 
      partner for 24 hours or 3 weeks, and transcriptomic regulations in the nucleus 
      accumbens were measured by RNA sequencing. RESULTS: We found sex-specific response 
      patterns despite similar behavioral indicators of pair-bond establishment. Indeed, 
      24 hours of cohabitation with an opposite-sex partner induced widespread 
      transcriptomic changes that remained sustained to some extent in females after 3 
      weeks but returned to baseline before a second set of regulations in males. This led 
      to a highly sexually biased nucleus accumbens transcriptome at 3 weeks related to 
      processes such as neurotransmission, protein turnover, and DNA transcription. In 
      particular, we found sex-specific alterations of mitochondrial dynamics following 
      cohabitation, with a shift toward fission in males. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to 
      identifying the genes, networks, and pathways involved in the pair-bonding process 
      in the nucleus accumbens, our work illustrates the vast extent of sex differences in 
      the molecular mechanisms underlying pair-bonding in prairie voles and paves the way 
      to further our understanding of the complex social bonding process.

TI  - Cardiorespiratory response to early rehabilitation in critically ill adults: A 
      secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early rehabilitation is indicated in critically ill adults to counter 
      functional complications. However, the physiological response to rehabilitation is 
      poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the cardiorespiratory response to 
      rehabilitation and to investigate the effect of explanatory variables on 
      physiological changes during rehabilitation and recovery. METHODS: In a 
      prospectively planned, secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial conducted 
      in a tertiary, mixed intensive care unit (ICU), we analysed the 716 
      physiotherapy-led, pragmatic rehabilitation sessions (including exercise, cycling 
      and mobilisation). Participants were previously functionally independent, 
      mechanically ventilated, critically ill adults (n = 108). Physiological data 
      (2-minute medians) were collected with standard ICU monitoring and indirect 
      calorimetry, and their medians calculated for baseline (30min before), training 
      (during physiotherapy) and recovery (15min after). We visualised physiological 
      trajectories and investigated explanatory variables on their estimated effect with 
      mixed-effects models. RESULTS: This study found a large range of variation within 
      and across participants' sessions with clinically relevant variations (>10%) 
      occurring in more than 1 out of 4 sessions in mean arterial pressure, minute 
      ventilation (MV) and oxygen consumption (VO2), although early rehabilitation did not 
      generally affect physiological values from baseline to training or recovery. Active 
      patient participation increased MV (mean difference 0.7l/min [0.4-1.0, p<0.001]) and 
      VO2 (23ml/min [95%CI: 13-34, p<0.001]) during training when compared to passive 
      participation. Similarly, session type 'mobilisation' increased heart rate (6.6bpm 
      [2.1-11.2, p = 0.006]) during recovery when compared to 'exercise'. Other modifiable 
      explanatory variables included session duration, mobilisation level and daily 
      medication, while non-modifiable variables were age, gender, body mass index and the 
      daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment. CONCLUSIONS: A large range of variation 
      during rehabilitation and recovery mirrors the heterogenous interventions and 
      patient reactions. This warrants close monitoring and individual tailoring, whereby 
      the best option to stimulate a cardiorespiratory response seems to be active patient 
      participation, shorter session durations and mobilisation. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Accelerometer-Measured, Habitual Physical Activity and Circulating Brain-Derived 
      Neurotrophic Factor: A Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - 805-814
LID - 10.3233/JAD-215109 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the mechanisms suggested to link physical activity (PA) to 
      favorable brain health is through stimulation of neural growth factors such as 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Acute bouts of PA stimulate circulating 
      BDNF levels. OBJECTIVE: In this investigation, we assessed whether habitual, 
      accelerometer-measured PA levels were related to circulating BDNF levels in a 
      middle-aged cohort. METHODS: In the Framingham Heart Study Third Generation cohort, 
      1,769 participants provided reliable accelerometry data and were not missing BDNF 
      measurement or platelet counts. In a cross-sectional analysis, using multivariable 
      regression, we related PA measures to serum BDNF levels, adjusting for age, sex, 
      smoking status, platelet count, depression status, and accelerometer wear time. 
      RESULTS: Our study participants (mean age 47±9 years, 50.8% women) spent an average 
      of 22.3 mins/day in moderate-to-vigorous (MV)PA. Most PA variables (steps, MVPA, 
      light activity, and sedentary time) were not related to BDNF levels (p > 0.05). We 
      observed a non-linear trend, where 15-50 mins/week vigorous activity was associated 
      with lower BDNF compared to those with 0 min vigorous activity (β= -0.049±0.024, 
      p = 0.05), but with no significant associations at lower or higher vigorous activity 
      levels. In smokers, MVPA was also associated with lower BDNF levels 
      (β= -0.216±0.079, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that circulating BDNF is 
      not chronically elevated in individuals with higher levels of habitual PA in 
      middle-aged adults from the community and may even be chronically suppressed with 
      higher PA in subgroups, including current smokers. These results do not contradict 
      previous studies demonstrating that circulating BDNF rises acutely after PA.

TI  - Preserved β-adrenergic-mediated vasodilation in skeletal muscle of young adults with 
      obesity despite shifts in cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide synthase.
PG  - H25-H35
LID - 10.1152/ajpheart.00449.2021 [doi]
AB  - Central adiposity is associated with greater sympathetic support of blood pressure. 
      β-adrenergic receptors (β-AR) buffer sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction and 
      β-AR-mediated vasodilation is attenuated in preclinical models of obesity. With this 
      information, we hypothesized β-AR vasodilation would be lower in obese compared with 
      normal weight adults. Because β-AR vasodilation in normal weight adults is limited 
      by cyclooxygenase (COX) restraint of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), we further 
      explored the contributions of COX and NOS to β-AR vasodilation in this cohort. 
      Forearm blood flow (FBF, Doppler ultrasound) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP, 
      brachial arterial catheter) were measured and forearm vascular conductance (FVC) was 
      calculated (FVC = FBF/MAP). The rise in FVC from baseline (ΔFVC) was quantified 
      during graded brachial artery infusion of isoproterenol (Iso, 1-12 ng/100 g/min) in 
      normal weight (n = 36) and adults with obesity (n = 22) (18-40 yr old). In a subset 
      of participants, Iso-mediated vasodilation was examined before and during inhibition 
      of NOS [N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA)], COX (ketorolac), and NOS + COX (l-NMMA 
      + ketorolac). Iso-mediated increases in FVC did not differ between groups (P = 
      0.57). l-NMMA attenuated Iso-mediated ΔFVC in normal weight (P = 0.03) but not 
      adults with obesity (P = 0.27). In normal weight adults, ketorolac increased 
      Iso-mediated ΔFVC (P < 0.01) and this response was lost with concurrent l-NMMA (P = 
      0.67). In contrast, neither ketorolac (P = 0.81) nor ketorolac + l-NMMA (P = 0.40) 
      altered Iso-mediated ΔFVC in adults with obesity. Despite shifts in COX and NOS, 
      β-AR vasodilation is preserved in young adults with obesity. These data highlight 
      the presence of a compensatory shift in microvascular control mechanisms in younger 
      humans with obesity.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We examined β-adrenergic receptor-mediated 
      vasodilation in skeletal muscle of humans with obesity and normal weight. Results 
      show that despite shifts in the contribution of cyclooxygenase and nitric oxide 
      synthase, β-adrenergic-mediated vasodilation is relatively preserved in young, 
      otherwise healthy adults with obesity. These data highlight the presence of 
      subclinical changes in microvascular control mechanisms early in the obesity process 
      and suggest duration of obesity and/or the addition of primary aging may be 
      necessary for overt dysfunction.

TI  - Health-Related Criterion-Referenced Cut-Points for Cardiorespiratory Fitness Among 
      Youth: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 101-122
LID - 10.1007/s40279-021-01537-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), which reflects the overall aerobic 
      capacity of the cardiovascular, respiratory, and muscular systems, is significantly 
      related to health among youth. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to 
      identify health-related criterion-referenced cut-points for CRF among youth aged 
      5-17 years. METHODS: A systematic search of two electronic databases (MEDLINE and 
      SPORTDiscus) was conducted in September 2020. Only peer-reviewed studies that 
      developed health-related criterion-referenced cut-points for CRF among youth were 
      eligible provided they included (1) youth aged 5-17 years from the general 
      population; (2) at least one quantitative assessment of CRF (e.g., peak oxygen 
      uptake [[Formula: see text]O(2peak)]); (3) at least one quantitative assessment of 
      health (e.g., cardiometabolic risk); (4) a criterion for health; and (5) a 
      quantitative analysis (e.g., receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve) of at 
      least one health-related cut-point for CRF. A narrative synthesis was used to 
      describe the results of the included studies. RESULTS: Collectively, 29 included 
      studies developed health-related criterion-referenced cut-points for CRF among 
      193,311 youth from 23 countries. CRF cut-points, expressed as [Formula: see 
      text]O(2peak), estimated using the 20-m shuttle run test, demonstrated high 
      discriminatory ability (median area under the curve [AUC] ≥ 0.71) for both 
      cardiometabolic and obesity risk. Cut-points derived from maximal cycle-ergometer 
      tests demonstrated moderate discriminatory ability (median AUC 0.64-0.70) for 
      cardiometabolic risk, and low discriminatory ability for early subclinical 
      atherosclerosis (median AUC 0.56-0.63). Cut-points for CRF using submaximal 
      treadmill exercise testing demonstrated high discriminatory ability for 
      cardiometabolic risk, but only moderate discriminatory ability for obesity risk. CRF 
      cut-points estimated using submaximal step testing demonstrated high discriminatory 
      ability for cardiometabolic risk and moderate discriminatory ability for high blood 
      pressure, while those for the 9-min walk/run test demonstrated moderate-to-high 
      discriminatory ability for obesity risk. Collectively, CRF cut-points, expressed as 
      [Formula: see text]O(2peak), demonstrated moderate-to-high discriminatory ability 
      (median AUC ≥ 0.64) for cardiometabolic risk, obesity risk, and high blood pressure. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is too wide a range of health-related 
      criterion-referenced cut-points for CRF among youth to suggest universal age- and 
      sex-specific thresholds. To further inform the development of universal cut-points, 
      there is a need for additional research, using standardized testing protocols and 
      health-risk definitions, that examines health-related criterion-referenced 
      cut-points for CRF that are age, sex, and culturally diverse. CLINICAL TRIALS

TI  - Exploring Barriers to and Enablers of the Adoption of Information and Communication 
      Technology for the Care of Older Adults With Chronic Diseases: Scoping Review.
PG  - e25251
LID - 10.2196/25251 [doi]
LID - e25251
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information and communication technology (ICT) offers considerable 
      potential for supporting older adults in managing their health, including chronic 
      diseases. However, there are mixed opinions about the benefits and effectiveness of 
      ICT interventions for older adults with chronic diseases. OBJECTIVE: We aim to map 
      the use of ICT interventions in health care and identified barriers to and enablers 
      of its use among older adults with chronic disease. METHODS: A scoping review was 
      conducted using 5 databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, PsycINFO, and ProQuest) 
      to identify eligible articles from January 2000 to July 2020. Publications 
      incorporating the use of ICT interventions, otherwise known as eHealth, such as 
      mobile health, telehealth and telemedicine, decision support systems, electronic 
      health records, and remote monitoring in people aged ≥55 years with chronic diseases 
      were included. We conducted a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats 
      framework analysis to explore the implied enablers of and barriers to the use of ICT 
      interventions. RESULTS: Of the 1149 identified articles, 31 (2.7%; n=4185 
      participants) met the inclusion criteria. Of the 31 articles, 5 (16%) mentioned the 
      use of various eHealth interventions. A range of technologies was reported, 
      including mobile health (8/31, 26%), telehealth (7/31, 23%), electronic health 
      record (2/31, 6%), and mixed ICT interventions (14/31, 45%). Various chronic 
      diseases affecting older adults were identified, including congestive heart failure 
      (9/31, 29%), diabetes (7/31, 23%), chronic respiratory disease (6/31, 19%), and 
      mental health disorders (8/31, 26%). ICT interventions were all designed to help 
      people self-manage chronic diseases and demonstrated positive effects. However, 
      patient-related and health care provider-related challenges, in integrating ICT 
      interventions in routine practice, were identified. Barriers to using ICT 
      interventions in older adults included knowledge gaps, a lack of willingness to 
      adopt new skills, and reluctance to use technologies. Implementation challenges 
      related to ICT interventions such as slow internet connectivity and lack of an 
      appropriate reimbursement policy were reported. Advantages of using ICT 
      interventions include their nonpharmacological nature, provision of health 
      education, encouragement for continued physical activity, and maintenance of a 
      healthy diet. Participants reported that the use of ICT was a fun and effective way 
      of increasing their motivation and supporting self-management tasks. It gave them 
      reassurance and peace of mind by promoting a sense of security and reducing anxiety. 
      CONCLUSIONS: ICT interventions have the potential to support the care of older 
      adults with chronic diseases. However, they have not been effectively integrated 
      with routine health care. There is a need to improve awareness and education about 
      ICT interventions among those who could benefit from them, including older adults, 
      caregivers, and health care providers. More sustainable funding is required to 
      promote the adoption of ICT interventions. We recommend involving clinicians and 
      caregivers at the time of designing ICT interventions.

TI  - Correlations between Diabetes Mellitus Self-Care Activities and Glycaemic Control in 
      the Adult Population: A Cross-Sectional Study.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10010174 [doi]
LID - 174
AB  - Although it is well known that lifestyle changes can affect plasma glucose levels, 
      there is little formal evidence for the sustained effectiveness of exercise and diet 
      in diabetes mellitus (DM) management. Self-care in DM refers to the real-life 
      application of the knowledge that the patient gained during the education 
      programmes. The goals are to bring about changes in the patient's behaviour, thus 
      improving glycaemic control. We evaluated the influence of DM self-care activities 
      (SCA) on glycaemic control in a total of 159 patients with DM. Plasma glycated 
      haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were used to monitor glycaemic control, while SCA were 
      assessed using the standardised Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire (DSMQ). In 
      our study, 53% of the patients had a HbA1c ≥ 7%. In univariate linear regression 
      models, a statistically significant inverse association was observed between the 
      HbA1c (the dependent variable) and both the DSMQ Dietary Control Score (R2 = 0.037, 
      p = 0.0145) and the DSMQ Sum Score (R2 = 0.06, p = 0.0014). The mean absolute change 
      in the HbA1c% associated with one standard deviation (SD) change in the DSMQ Sum 
      Score, independent of the other significant variables retained in the compacted 
      multivariate regression model, was -0.419% (confidence interval: 95%: from -0.18 to 
      -0.65). Although the impact of the DSMQ Score was modest when compared to the other 
      independent variables in the multivariate model, the findings emphasise the 
      importance of maintaining optimal lifestyle changes to avoid hyperglycaemia and its 
      complications. In conclusion, enhanced self-management of DM is associated with 
      improved glucose control. In patients with chronic diseases such as DM, the role of 
      streamlining SCA encompassing physical activity and proper dietary choices is 
      imperative because of a significantly reduced access to healthcare globally as a 
      result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Understanding Cancer Screening Intention Among Physically Active Adults Ages 18-49.
LID - 10.1007/s13187-022-02142-2 [doi]
AB  - Ideal efforts for cancer prevention would include lifestyle modifications along with 
      routine, age-eligible cancer screening. Employing an asset-based approach within 
      vulnerable populations already engaging in at least one healthy behavior (i.e., 
      physical activity) may be an ideal way to further reduce cancer risk across peer 
      groups with low cancer screening rates. Guided by the theory of planned behavior 
      (TPB), the aim of this study was to identify constructs associated with cancer 
      screening intentions among young to middle aged adults for influencing educational 
      and behavioral interventions designed to promote cancer prevention. A 
      cross-sectional, web-based survey was utilized to assess attitudes, subjective 
      norms, perceived behavioral control, and intention to screen for cancer among 
      physically active adults aged 18-49 years. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were 
      conducted to characterize the sample, and hierarchical linear regression analyses 
      were conducted to assess the influence of sociodemographic variables and TPB 
      constructs on cancer screening intentions. Age, female sex, reporting a routine 
      doctor's visit, reported knowledge of physical activity as a lifestyle behavior to 
      reduce cancer risk, and an increased number of motivating factors for engaging in 
      physical activity were significantly associated with higher cancer screening 
      intention (P < 0.001). With the addition of TPB constructs (i.e., subjective norms 
      and perceived behavioral control), the final analytic model accounted for 31% of the 
      variance in intention to screen for cancer. Findings suggest that the TPB could be 
      used to tailor or design asset-based, cancer education interventions to effectively 
      promote age-eligible cancer screenings among physically active adults. Educational 
      content to increase social support for cancer screening and enhance perceived 
      behavioral control to complete screening is essential in this population.

TI  - A Component Evaluation of a Randomised Control Community Intervention to Reduce 
      Adolescent Alcohol Use in Australia.
PG  - 36-47
LID - 10.1007/s11121-021-01310-y [doi]
AB  - Despite a decline in Australian adolescents reporting to have consumed alcohol, a 
      high proportion of the adolescent population still consumes alcohol. Community-led 
      prevention interventions that systematically and strategically implement 
      evidence-based programs have been shown to be effective in producing 
      population-behaviour change related to youth alcohol and drug use. This study 
      evaluated the post-intervention effects of a multi-component community intervention 
      in Australia. It comprised social marketing targeting adolescents and parents, and a 
      community intervention to reduce underage alcohol sales. Structural equation 
      modelling was used to examine direct and indirect effects of community intervention 
      components on intention and consumption. Self-report surveys (N = 3377) and 
      community sales data (27 communities) were analysed to evaluate the effect of the 
      intervention components on intention and consumption before the age of 18. The 
      intervention reduced alcohol sales to minors (OR = .82). Exposure to the social 
      marketing was significantly associated with household no-alcohol rules (OR = 2.24) 
      and parents not supplying alcohol (OR = .72). The intervention predicted intention 
      not to consume alcohol before age 18; intention was associated with not consuming 
      alcohol (OR = 5.70). Total indirect effects from the intervention through to 
      intention were significant. However, parents setting a rule and not supplying 
      alcohol were the only significant direct effects to intention. Parents setting a 
      rule was directly associated with lower consumption. Overall, the intervention logic 
      was supported by the data modelling. The study extends prior knowledge of 
      community-based interventions to prevent adolescent alcohol use by identifying 
      critical intervention components and effect mechanisms. ClinicalTrials.gov

TI  - Phosphoproteomic analysis of duck egg yolk provides novel insights into its 
      characteristics and biofunctions.
PG  - 1165-1173
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.11453 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the importance of phosphorylation in the function of proteins 
      is known, investigation of the protein phosphorylation of duck egg yolk (DEY) is 
      still very limited. This study aimed to conduct a detailed phosphoproteomic study of 
      DEY using immobilized metal affinity chromatography and ultra-high liquid 
      chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: A total of 253 phosphorylation 
      sites assigned to 66 phosphoproteins were identified in DEY, of which VTG-1, VTG-2, 
      and fibrinogen alpha chain were found to be the highly phosphorylated proteins in 
      DEY. The biological functions of the identified phosphoproteins were illuminated 
      through gene ontology analysis, which showed that they were mainly involved in 
      binding, catalytic, immune response, and metabolic activity. S-X-E and S-X-S were 
      found to be the most conserved serine motifs of phosphorylation in DEY. The 
      comparison of DEY phosphoproteins with those of chicken egg yolk (CEY) revealed that 
      differences mostly involved molecular functions and biological processes. The 
      comparison also revealed a higher phosphorylation level in DEY proteins. CONCLUSION: 
      The higher phosphorylation level in DEY proteins than that in CEY proteins are 
      supposed to help enhance duck growth performance and biological activities (e.g. 
      antibacterial and antioxidant ability) for better adapting the humid environment the 
      duck lived. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI  - Ageing well with diabetes: A workshop to co-design research recommendations for 
      improving the diabetes care of older people.
PG  - e14795
LID - 10.1111/dme.14795 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To identify key research questions where answers could improve care for older 
      people living with diabetes (PLWD), and provide detailed recommendations for 
      researchers and research funders on how best to address them. METHODS: A series of 
      online research workshops were conducted, bringing together a range of PLWD and an 
      acknowledged group of academic and clinical experts in their diabetes care to 
      identify areas for future research. Throughout the pre-workshop phase, during each 
      workshop, and in manuscript preparation and editing, PLWD played an active and 
      dynamic role in discussions as part of both an iterative and narrative process. 
      RESULTS: The following key questions in this field were identified, and research 
      recommendations for each were developed: How can we improve our understanding of the 
      characteristics of older people living with diabetes (PLWD) and their outcomes, and 
      can this deliver better person-centred care? How are services to care for older PLWD 
      currently delivered, both for their diabetes and other conditions? How can we 
      optimise and streamline the process and ensure everyone gets the best care, tailored 
      to their individual needs? What tools might be used to evaluate the level of 
      understanding of diabetes in the older population amongst non-specialist Healthcare 
      Professionals (HCPs)? How can virtual experts or centres most effectively provide 
      access to specialist multi-disciplinary team (MDT) expertise for older PLWD and the 
      HCPs caring for them? Is a combination of exercise and a nutrition-dense, high 
      protein diet effective in the prevention of the adverse effects of type 2 diabetes 
      and deterioration in frailty, and how might this be delivered in a way which is 
      acceptable to people with type 2 diabetes? How might we best use continuous glucose 
      monitoring (CGM) in older people and, for those who require support, how should the 
      data be shared? How can older PLWD be better empowered to manage their diabetes in 
      their own home, particularly when living with additional long-term conditions? What 
      are the benefits of models of peer support for older PLWD, both when living 
      independently and when in care? CONCLUSIONS: This paper outlines recommendations 
      supported by PLWD through which new research could improve their diabetes care and 
      calls on the research community and funders to address them in future research 
      programmes and strategies.

TI  - Waist circumference was associated with 2-year blood pressure change in community 
      dwelling adults independently of BMI.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1097/MBP.0000000000000558 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to analyze the association of 2-year changes in 
      BMI and waist circumference with changes in blood pressure (BP) in a randomized 
      sample of community-dwelling adults. METHODS: A sample of 331 middle-aged and older 
      adults (mean age of 59.6 ± 17.3 years) was randomly selected. Measurements of SBP 
      and DBP, BMI, and waist circumference were collected at baseline and after 2-year 
      follow-up. Chronological age, sex, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and 
      self-reported medical diagnosis and use of medication for hypertension, diabetes, 
      and high low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were covariates. Multiple linear 
      regression models were adopted for statistical analysis. RESULTS: SBP was positively 
      associated with BMI (β = 0.48, P = 0.013) and waist circumference (β = 0.21, 
      P = 0.005) at baseline and only with waist circumference at follow-up (β = 0.20, 
      P = 0.007). DBP was positively associated with BMI (β = 0.31, P = 0.009) and waist 
      circumference (β = 0.12, P = 0.006) values at baseline and at follow-up (BMI 
      β = 0.42, P = 0.001; waist circumference β = 0.18, P = 0.001). Only the 2-year 
      changes in waist circumference were associated to changes in SBP (β = 0.33, 
      P = 0.013), regardless of confounding factors and BMI. CONCLUSION: It is suggested 
      that waist circumference is the main factor for control over the time in strategies 
      focused on BP management in adult population.

TI  - Evaluation of Communities That Care-Effects on Municipal Youth Crime Rates in 
      Victoria, Australia: 2010-2019.
PG  - 24-35
LID - 10.1007/s11121-021-01297-6 [doi]
AB  - Internationally, youth crime is a significant social problem. Violent youth crime 
      has been rising over the past decade in the state of Victoria, Australia. 
      Communities That Care (CTC) is a coalition training process designed to prevent 
      youth crime. There has been limited evaluation outside the USA. Using a 
      non-experimental design, this study employed official state crime statistics to 
      evaluate the impact on crime as the five-phase CTC process was implemented between 
      2010 and 2019 across communities in Victoria. The standard five-phase CTC 
      implementation cycle was supplemented with universal programs to reduce sales and 
      supply of alcohol to underage youth (under 18 years). Growth models evaluated 
      community trends in youth crime (all, person, property and deception and other), 
      comparing communities that implemented CTC at phase 4 or greater with communities 
      that had not implemented CTC. In accord with the hypotheses, the study found 
      significant reductions in crimes associated with CTC over the period between 2010 
      and 2019. A 2% annual reduction in risk was observed for crimes against persons for 
      all age groups (IRR = 0.98, 95% CI [0.96, 0.998]). A 5% annual reduction was 
      observed for crimes of property and deception for adolescents aged between 10 and 
      17 years (IRR = 0.95, 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]). These findings support CTC as an 
      intervention for preventing youth crime at a population level. Future studies should 
      evaluate intervention mechanisms and economic benefits.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Differences have been reported in incidence rates of fractures in the 
      pediatric population, between countries and over time. The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate the incidence and characteristics of fractures over 20 years among Israeli 
      children. METHODS: Incidence rates of fractures were derived from the electronic 
      database of Meuhedet Health Services, a health maintenance organization providing 
      healthcare services to 1.2 million people in Israel. Demographic and clinical data 
      were extracted of all the fractures in individuals aged <18 years during 2000-2019. 
      Fracture sites were determined according to ICD9 definitions. Fracture data were 
      analyzed by age, sex, season and sector (general Jewish population, ultra-orthodox 
      Jews and Arabs). RESULTS: During the study period 188,283 fractures occurred in 
      142,049 individuals. The most common were fractures of the upper limb (65%), 
      followed by fractures of the lower limb [20%]. The overall fracture rate was 251 per 
      10,000 person- years (PY), and was higher for boys than girls (319 vs. 180 per 
      10,000 PY, p < 0.001). During 20 years, standardized fracture rates decreased 
      significantly in the general Jewish population, among both boys (from 457 to 325 per 
      10,000 PY, p < 0.001) and girls (from 244 to 196 per 10,000 PY, p < 0.001); 
      increased among ultra-orthodox Jewish boys (from 249 to 285 per 10,000 PY, 
      p = 0.002) and girls (from 147 to 194 per 10,000 PY, p < 0.001); and did not change 
      significantly among Arab boys and girls. The fracture rate peaked among girls aged 
      10-11 years and among boys aged 12-13 years. Seasonal variation showed a bimodal 
      distribution with peaks during spring and autumn. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of 
      pediatric fractures is affected by age, gender, sector and season. Recognition of 
      fracture characteristics may help identify specific populations and conditions for 
      targeted prevention strategies.

AB  - With the growing demand for safe and nutritious foods, some novel food nonthermal 
      sterilization technologies were developed in recent years. Electrolyzed oxidizing 
      water (EOW) has the characteristics of strong antimicrobial ability, wide 
      sterilization range, and posing no threat to the humans and environment. 
      Furthermore, EOW can be used as a green disinfectant to replace conventional 
      production water used in the food industry since it can be converted to the ordinary 
      water after sterilization. This review summarizes recent developments of the EOW 
      technology in food industry. It also reviews the preparation principles, physical 
      and chemical characteristics, antimicrobial mechanisms of EOW, and inactivation of 
      toxins using EOW. In addition, this study highlights the applications of EOW in food 
      preservation and safety control, as well as the future prospects of this novel 
      technology. EOW is a promising nonthermal sterilization technology that has great 
      potential for applications in the food industry.

TI  - Joint associations of adiposity and alcohol consumption with liver disease-related 
      morbidity and mortality risk: findings from the UK Biobank.
PG  - 74-83
LID - 10.1038/s41430-021-00923-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of both non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and 
      alcoholic fatty liver disease (ALD) are expected to grow as a consequence of the 
      ongoing obesity and alcohol consumption trends. OBJECTIVE: We examined the joint 
      associations of adiposity (body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC)) and 
      alcohol consumption on ALD, NAFLD and liver disease incidence and mortality 
      (n = 465,437). METHODS: Alcohol consumption was categorised based on current UK 
      guidelines (14 units/week). Data were analysed using Cox proportional hazard models. 
      A total of 1090 liver disease deaths, 230 ALD deaths and 192 NAFLD deaths occurred 
      over an average follow-up length of 10.5 ± 1.7 years. RESULTS: In multivariate 
      models, we observed greater point estimates for risk of ALD, NAFLD and liver disease 
      incidence and mortality among overweight/obese participants who consumed alcohol at 
      the same level as normal weight participants. We found that overweight/obese 
      participants who reported alcohol consumption above the guidelines had a greater HR 
      for liver disease incidence and mortality (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.32, 1.75 and HR 2.20, 
      95% CI 1.41, 3.44, respectively) than normal weight individuals (HR 0.95, 95% CI 
      0.83, 1.09 and HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.8, 1.93, respectively). The results for the 
      associations of alcohol consumption and WC with ALD, NAFLD and liver disease 
      mortality were similar. Participants with high WC who reported alcohol consumption 
      above the guidelines had a greater HR for liver disease incidence (HR 1.59, 95% CI 
      1.35, 1.87) than normal WC individuals (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72, 1.01). CONCLUSIONS: We 
      found evidence that being overweight/obese amplified the harmful effect of alcohol 
      on the liver incidence and mortality.

TI  - Repeated Interval Loughborough Soccer Passing Tests: An Ecologically Valid Motor 
      Task to Induce Mental Fatigue in Soccer.
PG  - 803528
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2021.803528 [doi]
LID - 803528
AB  - Most studies investigating mental fatigue (MF) in soccer utilized a computerized 
      Stroop task to induce MF. However, the traditional key-pressing task has been 
      challenged for its lack of ecological validity. The limited relevance to real-life 
      soccer made it difficult to bridge the gap between the research and the applied 
      setting. Therefore, a novel soccer-specific inducing task is in urgent need. This 
      study compared a novel MF-inducing task in soccer with the Stroop task and 
      investigated the impact of induced MF on cognitive and soccer-specific skill 
      performance. A randomized, counterbalanced crossover design was employed. Fifteen 
      well-trained male soccer players randomly participated in three MF-inducing tasks. 
      Two of them were motor tasks consisting of 10 repeated interval Loughborough Soccer 
      Passing Test (10xLSPT or LSPT) in clockwise passing order (10xC-LSPT) with each 
      block starting every 2 min. The two tasks share the same movement pattern, but 
      C-LSPT is considered to have lower cognitive demands. The third was the 20-min 
      Stroop task (Stroop-20). MF was assessed immediately before and after each task by 
      visual analog scale (VAS), the cognitive performance in a 3-min Stroop task, and the 
      skill performance in one LSPT. Subjective MF increased similarly after 10xLSPT and 
      Stroop-20 (+ 25.4 ± 10.3 vs. + 23.4 ± 10.8 AU, p = 0.607). The induced MF by 10xLSPT 
      and Stroop-20 had no impact on cognitive performance and movement time but similarly 
      affected in a significantly negative manner on penalty time (+ 5.9 ± 4.9 vs. + 5.4 ± 
      4.2 s, p = 0.748) and passing accuracy (-1.4 ± 1.5 vs. -1.0 ± 1.3, p = 0.465). Two 
      motor tasks shared similar intensity, but 10xC-LSPT was inefficient to induce MF. 
      The results showed that the 20-min repeated interval LSPT could induce a similar MF 
      as the Stroop task. The induced MF had detrimental effects on soccer skill 
      performance. The novel motor task is recommended for MF studies in soccer as an 
      inducement task. Practitioners should be cautious about the prolonged 
      cognitive-demanding skill section of the pre-match warm-up to avoid the negative 
      effect of MF on the upcoming match. This motor task pattern could be followed as a 
      supplementary training protocol.

TI  - Weight loss is associated with reduced risk of knee and hip replacement: a survival 
      analysis using Osteoarthritis Initiative data.
LID - 10.1038/s41366-021-01046-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the association between body weight change and the risk of 
      knee replacement and hip replacement. DESIGN: Time-to-event survival analysis from a 
      population-based cohort of participants who had or were at risk of clinically 
      significant knee osteoarthritis at baseline. SETTING: Data from the Osteoarthritis 
      Initiative (OAI), which collected data from four clinical centres in the United 
      States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 8069 knees from 4081 participants, and 8076 hips 
      from 4064 participants (59.3% female) aged 45-79 years, with mean ± SD body mass 
      index (BMI) of 28.7 ± 4.8 kg/m(2), were included in the knee and hip analyses, 
      respectively. EXPOSURE: Body weight change from baseline as a percentage of baseline 
      at repeated follow-up visits over 8 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incidence of 
      primary knee or hip replacement during 8-year follow-up. RESULTS: Body weight change 
      had a small, positive, linear association with the risk of knee replacement 
      (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.04). Body 
      weight change was also positively and linearly associated with the risk of hip 
      replacement in hips that were persistently painful at baseline (adjusted HR 1.03; 
      95% CI 1.01-1.05), but not in hips that were not persistently painful at baseline. 
      There were no significant interactions between body weight change and baseline BMI 
      in the association with knee or hip replacement. CONCLUSIONS: In people with or at 
      risk of clinically significant knee osteoarthritis, every 1% weight loss was 
      associated with a 2% reduced risk of knee replacement and - in those people who also 
      had one or more persistently painful hips - a 3% reduced risk of hip replacement, 
      regardless of baseline BMI. Public health strategies that incorporate weight loss 
      interventions have the potential to reduce the burden of knee and hip replacement 
      surgery.

TI  - International consensus to standardise histopathological scoring for small bowel 
      strictures in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 479-486
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2021-324374 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Effective medical therapy and validated trial outcomes are lacking for 
      small bowel Crohn's disease (CD) strictures. Histopathology of surgically resected 
      specimens is the gold standard for correlation with imaging techniques. However, no 
      validated histopathological scoring systems are currently available for small bowel 
      stricturing disease. We convened an expert panel to evaluate the appropriateness of 
      histopathology scoring systems and items generated based on panel opinion. DESIGN: 
      Modified RAND/University of California Los Angeles methodology was used to determine 
      the appropriateness of 313 candidate items related to assessment of CD small bowel 
      strictures. RESULTS: In this exercise, diagnosis of naïve and anastomotic strictures 
      required increased bowel wall thickness, decreased luminal diameter or internal 
      circumference, and fibrosis of the submucosa. Specific definitions for stricture 
      features and technical sampling parameters were also identified. 
      Histopathologically, a stricture was defined as increased thickness of all layers of 
      the bowel wall, fibrosis of the submucosa and bowel wall, and muscularisation of the 
      submucosa. Active mucosal inflammatory disease was defined as neutrophilic 
      inflammation in the lamina propria and any crypt or intact surface epithelium, 
      erosion, ulcer and fistula. Chronic mucosal inflammatory disease was defined as 
      crypt architectural distortion and loss, pyloric gland metaplasia, Paneth cell 
      hyperplasia, basal lymphoplasmacytosis, plasmacytosis and fibrosis, or prominent 
      lymphoid aggregates at the mucosa/submucosa interface. None of the scoring systems 
      used to assess CD strictures were considered appropriate for clinical trials. 
      CONCLUSION: Standardised assessment of gross pathology and histopathology of CD 
      small bowel strictures will improve clinical trial efficiency and aid drug 
      development.

TI  - A collaborative approach to adopting/adapting guidelines. The Australian 24-hour 
      movement guidelines for children (5-12 years) and young people (13-17 years): An 
      integration of physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and sleep.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2018, the Australian Government updated the Australian Physical 
      Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines for Children and Young People. A 
      requirement of this update was the incorporation of a 24-hour approach to movement, 
      recognising the importance of adequate sleep. The purpose of this paper was to 
      describe how the updated Australian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Children and 
      Young People (5 to 17 years): an integration of physical activity, sedentary 
      behaviour and sleep were developed and the outcomes from this process. METHODS: The 
      GRADE-ADOLOPMENT approach was used to develop the guidelines. A Leadership Group was 
      formed, who identified existing credible guidelines. The Canadian 24-Hour Movement 
      Guidelines for Children and Youth best met the criteria established by the 
      Leadership Group. These guidelines were evaluated based on the evidence in the GRADE 
      tables, summaries of findings tables and recommendations from the Canadian 
      Guidelines. We conducted updates to each of the Canadian systematic reviews. A 
      Guideline Development Group reviewed, separately and in combination, the evidence 
      for each behaviour. A choice was then made to adopt or adapt the Canadian 
      recommendations for each behaviour or create de novo recommendations. We then 
      conducted an online survey (n=237) along with three focus groups (n=11 in total) and 
      13 key informant interviews. Stakeholders used these to provide feedback on the 
      draft guidelines. RESULTS: Based on the evidence from the Canadian systematic 
      reviews and the updated systematic reviews in Australia, the Guideline Development 
      Group agreed to adopt the Canadian recommendations and, apart from some minor 
      changes to the wording of good practice statements, maintain the wording of the 
      guidelines, preamble, and title of the Canadian Guidelines. The Australian 
      Guidelines provide evidence-informed recommendations for a healthy day (24-hours), 
      integrating physical activity, sedentary behaviour (including limits to screen 
      time), and sleep for children (5-12 years) and young people (13-17 years). 
      CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is only the second time the GRADE-ADOLOPMENT 
      approach has been used to develop movement behaviour guidelines. The judgments of 
      the Australian Guideline Development Group did not differ sufficiently to change the 
      directions and strength of the recommendations and as such, the Canadian Guidelines 
      were adopted with only very minor alterations. This allowed the Australian 
      Guidelines to be developed in a shorter time frame and at a lower cost. We recommend 
      the GRADE-ADOLOPMENT approach, especially if a credible set of guidelines that was 
      developed using the GRADE approach is available with all supporting materials. Other 
      countries may consider this approach when developing and/or revising national 
      movement guidelines.

TI  - Determinants of economic motivations for food choice: insights for the understanding 
      of consumer behaviour.
PG  - 127-139
LID - 10.1080/09637486.2021.1939659 [doi]
AB  - Food consumption involves several dimensions, being some of them directly associated 
      with the consumers' characteristics. The interrelationships between these domains 
      impact consumer behaviour for food choice and the consequent decisions for food 
      consumption. In these frameworks, economic motivations are determinant. On the other 
      hand, the scientific literature highlights that the economic-based stimuli to choose 
      food is still underexplored. In this perspective, the objective of this study was to 
      assess the main sociodemographic and anthropometric determinants of the economic 
      motivations for food choice. For that, a questionnaire survey was carried out 
      involving 11,919 respondents from 16 countries. A validated questionnaire was used, 
      translated into the native languages in all participating countries, using a 
      back-translation process. First, the information obtained was assessed through 
      factor analysis to reduce the number of variables associated with the economic 
      motivations and to identify indexes. After, and considering the indexes obtained as 
      dependent variables, a classification and regression tree analysis was performed. As 
      main insights, it is highlighted that the main determinants of the economic 
      motivations are country of residence, age, gender, civil state, professional 
      activity, educational level, living environment, responsibility for buying food, 
      weight, height, body mass index, healthy diets and physical exercise practices. 
      Additionally, the results also reveal that economic motivations may be associated 
      with two indexes, one related to convenience attitudes and the other to quality 
      concerns. Finally, the younger persons and the women are the social groups more 
      concerned with healthy diets and food quality. In conclusion, this work confirmed 
      that food choice is to a high extent influenced by several sociodemographic and 
      behavioural factors.

TI  - Genomic predictors of testosterone levels are associated with muscle fiber size and

PG  - 415-423

AB  - PURPOSE: Circulating testosterone levels are a heritable trait with anabolic 
      properties in various tissues, including skeletal muscle. So far, hundreds of single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with testosterone levels have been 
      identified in nonathletic populations. The aim of the present study was to test the 
      association of 822 testosterone-increasing SNPs with muscle-related traits (muscle 
      fiber size, fat-free mass and handgrip strength) and to validate the identified SNPs 
      in independent cohorts of strength and power athletes. METHODS: One hundred and 
      forty-eight physically active individuals (47 females, 101 males) were assessed for 
      cross-sectional area (CSA) of fast-twitch muscle fibers. Significant SNPs were 
      further assessed for fat-free mass and handgrip strength in > 354,000 participants 
      from the UK Biobank cohort. The validation cohorts included Russian elite athletes. 
      RESULTS: From an initial panel of 822 SNPs, we identified five 
      testosterone-increasing alleles (DOCK3 rs77031559 G, ESR1 rs190930099 G, GLIS3 
      rs34706136 TG, GRAMD1B rs850294 T, TRAIP rs62260729 C) nominally associated 
      (P < 0.05) with CSA of fast-twitch muscle fibers, fat-free mass and handgrip 
      strength. Based on these five SNPs, the number of testosterone-increasing alleles 
      was positively associated with testosterone levels in male athletes (P = 0.048) and 
      greater strength performance in weightlifters (P = 0.017). Moreover, the proportion 
      of participants with ≥ 2 testosterone-increasing alleles was higher in power 
      athletes compared to controls (68.9 vs. 55.6%; P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: 
      Testosterone-related SNPs are associated with muscle fiber size, fat-free mass and 
      strength, which combined can partially contribute to a greater predisposition to 
      strength/power sports.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review and frequently update the available evidence on injury risk 
      factors and epidemiology of injury in trail running. DESIGN: Living systematic 
      review. Updated searches will be done every 6 months for a minimum period of 5 
      years. DATA SOURCES: Eight electronic databases were searched from inception to 18 
      March 2021. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies that investigated injury risk factors 
      and/or reported the epidemiology of injury in trail running. RESULTS: Nineteen 
      eligible studies were included, of which 10 studies investigated injury risk factors 
      among 2 785 participants. Significant intrinsic factors associated with injury are: 
      more running experience, level A runner and higher total propensity to sports 
      accident questionnaire (PAD-22) score. Previous history of cramping and postrace 
      biomarkers of muscle damage is associated with cramping. Younger age and low skin 
      phototypes are associated with sunburn. Significant extrinsic factors associated 
      with injury are neglecting warm-up, no specialised running plan, training on 
      asphalt, double training sessions per day and physical labour occupations. A slower 
      race finishing time is associated with cramping, while more than 3 hours of training 
      per day, shade as the primary mode of sun protection and being single are associated 
      with sunburn. An injury incidence range 0.7-61.2 injuries/1000 hours of running and 
      prevalence range 1.3% to 90% were reported. The lower limb was the most reported 
      region of injury, specifically involving blisters of the foot/toe. CONCLUSION: 
      Limited studies investigated injury risk factors in trail running. Our review found 
      eight intrinsic and nine extrinsic injury risk factors. This review highlighted 
      areas for future research that may aid in designing injury risk management 
      strategies for safer trail running participation.PROSPERO registration

TI  - Low-dose fentanyl does not alter muscle sympathetic nerve activity, blood pressure, 
      or tolerance during progressive central hypovolemia.
PG  - R55-R63
LID - 10.1152/ajpregu.00217.2021 [doi]
AB  - Hemorrhage is a leading cause of battlefield and civilian trauma deaths. Several 
      pain medications, including fentanyl, are recommended for use in the prehospital 
      (i.e., field setting) for a hemorrhaging solider. However, it is unknown whether 
      fentanyl impairs arterial blood pressure (BP) regulation, which would compromise 
      hemorrhagic tolerance. Thus, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis 
      that an analgesic dose of fentanyl impairs hemorrhagic tolerance in conscious 
      humans. Twenty-eight volunteers (13 females) participated in this double-blinded, 
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial. We conducted a presyncopal limited progressive 
      lower body negative pressure test (LBNP; a validated model to simulate hemorrhage) 
      following intravenous administration of fentanyl (75 µg) or placebo (saline). We 
      quantified tolerance as a cumulative stress index (mmHg·min), which was compared 
      between trials using a paired, two-tailed t test. We also compared muscle 
      sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA; microneurography) and beat-to-beat BP 
      (photoplethysmography) during the LBNP test using a mixed effects model [time (LBNP 
      stage) × trial]. LBNP tolerance was not different between trials (fentanyl: 
      647 ± 386 vs. placebo: 676 ± 295 mmHg·min, P = 0.61, Cohen's d = 0.08). Increases in 
      MSNA burst frequency (time: P < 0.01, trial: P = 0.29, interaction: P = 0.94) and 
      reductions in mean BP (time: P < 0.01, trial: P = 0.50, interaction: P = 0.16) 
      during LBNP were not different between trials. These data, the first to be obtained 
      in conscious humans, demonstrate that administration of an analgesic dose of 
      fentanyl does not alter MSNA or BP during profound central hypovolemia, nor does it 
      impair tolerance to this simulated hemorrhagic insult.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Profile of Incremental Oral Doses of Dietary Nitrate in Young and 
      Older Adults: A Crossover Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 130-139
LID - 10.1093/jn/nxab354 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dietary nitrate consumption can increase concentrations of nitrate and 
      nitrite in blood, saliva, and urine. Whether the change in concentrations is 
      influenced by age is currently unknown. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to measure changes in 
      nitrate and nitrite concentrations in plasma, urine, and saliva and exhaled NO 
      concentrations after single incremental doses of dietary nitrate in young and older 
      healthy adults. METHODS: Twelve young (18-35 y old) and 12 older (60-75 y old) 
      healthy, nonsmoking participants consumed single doses of 100 g, 200 g, 300 g whole 
      beetroot (BR) and 1000 mg potassium nitrate (positive control) ≥7 d apart in a 
      crossover, randomized clinical trial. Plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations and 
      exhaled NO concentrations were measured over a 5-h period. Salivary nitrate and 
      nitrite concentrations were measured over a 12-h period and urinary nitrate over a 
      24-h period. Time, intervention, age, and interaction effects were measured with 
      repeated-measures ANOVAs. RESULTS: Dose-dependent increases were seen in plasma, 
      salivary, and urinary nitrate after BR ingestion (all P ≤ 0.002) but there were no 
      differences between age groups at baseline (all P ≥ 0.56) or postintervention (all 
      P ≥ 0.12). Plasma nitrite concentrations were higher in young than older 
      participants at baseline (P = 0.04) and after consumption of 200 g (P = 0.04; 
      +25.7 nmol/L; 95% CI: 0.97, 50.3 nmol/L) and 300 g BR (P = 0.02; +50.3 nmol/L; 95% 
      CI: 8.57, 92.1 nmol/L). Baseline fractional exhaled NO (FeNO) concentrations were 
      higher in the younger group [P = 0.03; +8.60 parts per billion (ppb); 95% CI: 0.80, 
      16.3 ppb], and rose significantly over the 5-h period, peaking 5 h after KNO3 
      consumption (39.4 ± 4.5 ppb; P < 0.001); however, changes in FeNO were not 
      influenced by age (P = 0.276). CONCLUSIONS: BR is a source of bioavailable dietary 
      nitrate in both young and older adults and can effectively raise nitrite and nitrate 
      concentrations. Lower plasma nitrite and FeNO concentrations were found in older 
      subjects, confirming the impact of ageing on NO bioavailability across different 
      systems.This trial was registered at www.isrctn.com as ISRCTN86706442.

      markers.
PG  - e12239

LID - e12239
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fasting glucose increases with age and is linked to modifiable 
      Alzheimer's disease risk factors such as cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes 
      (T2D). METHODS: We leveraged available biospecimens and neuroimaging measures 
      collected during the Alzheimer's Prevention Through Exercise (APEx) trial (n = 105) 
      to examine the longitudinal relationship between change in blood glucose metabolism 
      and change in regional cerebral amyloid deposition and gray and white matter (WM) 
      neurodegeneration in older adults over 1 year of follow-up. RESULTS: Individuals 
      with improving fasting glucose (n = 61) exhibited less atrophy and regional amyloid 
      accumulation compared to those whose fasting glucose worsened over 1 year (n = 44). 
      Specifically, while individuals with increasing fasting glucose did not yet show 
      cognitive decline, they did have regional atrophy in the hippocampus and inferior 
      parietal cortex, and increased amyloid accumulation in the precuneus cortex. Signs 
      of early dementia pathology occurred in the absence of significant group differences 
      in insulin or body composition, and was not modified by apolipoprotein E ε4 carrier 
      status. DISCUSSION: Dysregulation of glucose in late life may signal preclinical 
      brain change prior to clinically relevant cognitive decline. Additional work is 
      needed to determine whether treatments specifically targeting fasting glucose levels 
      may impact change in brain structure or cerebral amyloid in older adults.

TI  - The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Lifestyles and Levels of Anxiety and 
      Depression of Patients with Schizophrenia: A Retrospective Observational Study.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10010128 [doi]
LID - 128
AB  - The movement restrictions put in place as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic required 
      modification of the population's usual routines, including those of the most 
      vulnerable groups such as patients with schizophrenia. This was a retrospective 
      observational study. We used an online survey to collect information on patient 
      adherence to the Mediterranean diet (Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener 
      questionnaire), physical exercise (International Physical Activity Questionnaire 
      Short Form), and tobacco consumption and levels of anxiety and depression (Hospital 
      Anxiety and Depression Scale) before and during the movement restrictions. A total 
      of 102 people with schizophrenia participated in this study. During the COVID-19 
      pandemic lockdown the participants significantly increased the number of minutes 
      spent sitting per day (z = -6.73; p < 0.001), decreased the time they spent walking 
      (z = -6.32; p < 0.001), and increased their tobacco consumption (X(2) = 156.90; p < 
      0.001). These results were also accompanied by a significant increase in their 
      reported levels of anxiety (z = -7.45; p < 0.001) and depression (z = -7.03, p < 
      0.001). No significant differences in patient diets during the pandemic compared to 
      before the movement restrictions were reported. These results suggest the need to 
      implement specific programs to improve lifestyle and reduce anxiety and depression 
      during possible future pandemic situations.

TI  - Randomized controlled trial of financial incentives during weight-loss induction and 
      maintenance in online group weight control.
PG  - 106-116
LID - 10.1002/oby.23322 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the impact of a financial incentive scheme 
      integrating process and outcome incentives across weight-loss induction and weight 
      maintenance on 18-month weight outcomes. METHODS: This was a randomized controlled 
      trial. Participants with overweight or obesity (n = 418; 91% female; 28% 
      racial/ethnic minority) were randomized to an 18-month, online, group-based 
      behavioral weight-control program (Internet-Only) or the same program with financial 
      incentives provided for 12 months, contingent on self-regulatory weight-control 
      behaviors (self-weighing, dietary self-monitoring, and physical activity) and 
      weight-outcome benchmarks (Internet+Incentives). No financial incentives were 
      provided from Months 13 to 18 to examine the durability of weight-control behaviors 
      and outcomes without incentives. RESULTS: Weight-loss induction at Month 6 was 
      significantly greater for Internet+Incentives than Internet-Only (6.8% vs. 4.9%, 
      respectively, p = 0.01). Individuals receiving incentives were significantly more 
      likely to maintain weight loss ≥ 5% at Month 12 (45% in Internet+Incentives vs. 32% 
      in Internet-Only, p < 0.02) and remain weight stable (39% vs. 27%, respectively, p < 
      0.01). Internet+Incentives participants also reported significantly greater 
      behavioral engagement through Month 12. However, once incentives ceased, there were 
      no differences in sustained weight outcomes (Month 18), and engagement declined 
      dramatically. CONCLUSIONS: Despite promoting greater treatment engagement and 
      initial weight loss, financial incentives as offered in this study did not promote 
      better extended weight control.

TI  - Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Fat Mass, and Cardiometabolic Health with Endothelial 
      Function, Arterial Elasticity, and Stiffness.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine whether estimated cardiorespiratory fitness 
      (CRF), fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM), and adiponectin bidirectionally associate with 
      arterial function and structure and if CRF mediates the relationship between 
      cardiometabolic health and arterial outcomes in 9- to 11-yr-old children drawn from 
      the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children birth cohort, United Kingdom. 
      METHODS: Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), distensibility coefficient 
      (DC), and carotid-radial pulse wave velocity (PWV) were measured by ultrasonography; 
      CRF was measured during the submaximal ergometer test; total FM, trunk FM, and LM 
      were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; plasma adiponectin was measured 
      by enzyme assay; and cardiometabolic health was computed based on the International 
      Diabetes Federation criteria for diagnosing metabolic syndrome. We tested 
      bidirectionality by including CRF, FM, LM, and adiponectin as exposures and FMD, DC, 
      and PWV as outcomes, alternatively. RESULTS: Among 5566 participants (2816 (51%) 
      girls; median age, 9.75 yr), CRF per body mass0.21 was directly related to DC (β 
      (95% confidence interval) = 0.004 (<0.0001 to 0.008); P = 0.046), whereas CRF per 
      LM0.54 was inversely associated with PWV (-0.034 (-0.063 to -0.003); 0.032) after 
      adjusting for covariates. These associations remained in bidirectional analyses. 
      Total FM, trunk FM, and LM were bidirectionally and positively associated with FMD 
      and DC. Total FM and trunk FM but not LM had bidirectional and inverse associations 
      with PWV. Adiponectin was not related to FMD, DC, or PWV. CRF partially mediated the 
      associations of cardiometabolic health with FMD (1.5% mediation), DC (12.1% 
      mediation), and PWV (3.5% mediation). CONCLUSIONS: Associations of poor 
      cardiometabolic health with adverse arterial structure and function in childhood may 
      be mitigated by increasing CRF. Higher CRF was associated with better arterial 
      structure whereas higher total FM and trunk FM were associated with better arterial 
      function and structure. In the reverse analysis, healthy arterial structure and 
      function were independently associated with increased total FM and trunk FM, 
      suggesting an "arterial paradox."

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Nursing homes are a primary setting of COVID-19 transmission and death, 
      but research has primarily focused only on factors within nursing homes. We 
      investigated the relationship between US nursing home-associated COVID-19 infection 
      rates and county-level and nursing home attributes. METHODS: We constructed panel 
      data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) minimum dataset, CMS 
      nursing home data, 2010 US Census data, 5-year (2012-2016) American Community Survey 
      estimates, and county COVID-19 infection rates. We analyzed COVID-19 data from June 
      1, 2020, through January 31, 2021, during 7 five-week periods. We used a maximum 
      likelihood estimator, including an autoregressive term, to estimate effects and 
      changes over time. We performed 3 model forms (basic, partial, and full) for 
      analysis. RESULTS: Nursing homes with nursing (0.005) and staff (0.002) shortages 
      had high COVID-19 infection rates, and locally owned (-0.007) or state-owned 
      (-0.025) and nonprofit (-0.011) agencies had lower COVID-19 infection rates than 
      privately owned agencies. County-level COVID-19 infection rates corresponded with 
      COVID-19 infection rates in nursing homes. Racial and ethnic minority groups had 
      high nursing home-associated COVID-19 infection rates early in the study. High 
      median annual personal income (-0.002) at the county level correlated with lower 
      nursing home-associated COVID-19 infection rates. CONCLUSIONS: Communities with low 
      rates of nursing home infections had access to more resources (eg, financial 
      resources, staffing) and likely had better mitigation efforts in place earlier in 
      the pandemic than nursing homes that had access to few resources and poor mitigation 
      efforts. Future research should address the social and structural determinants of 
      health that are leaving racial and ethnic minority populations and institutions such 
      as nursing homes vulnerable during times of crises.

TI  - The Impact of Long-term Physical Inactivity on Adipose Tissue Immunometabolism.
PG  - 177-191
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgab647 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Adipose tissue and physical inactivity both influence metabolic health and 
      systemic inflammation, but how adipose tissue responds to chronic physical 
      inactivity is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to characterize the impact of 
      chronic physical inactivity on adipose tissue in healthy, young males. METHODS: We 
      collected subcutaneous adipose tissue from 20 healthy, young men before and after 60 
      days of complete bed rest with energy intake reduced to maintain energy balance and 
      fat mass. We used RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, ex vivo tissue culture, and 
      targeted protein analyses to examine adipose tissue phenotype. RESULTS: Our results 
      indicate that the adipose tissue transcriptome, stromal cellular compartment, and 
      insulin signaling protein abundance are largely unaffected by bed rest when fat mass 
      is kept stable. However, there was an increase in the circulating concentration of 
      several adipokines, including plasma leptin, which was associated with 
      inactivity-induced increases in plasma insulin and absent from adipose tissue 
      cultured ex vivo under standardized culture conditions. CONCLUSION: Physical 
      inactivity-induced disturbances to adipokine concentrations such as leptin, without 
      changes to fat mass, could have profound metabolic implications outside a clinical 
      facility when energy intake is not tightly controlled.

TI  - Fish oil supplementation may improve attention, working memory, and ADHD symptoms in 
      adults with autism spectrum disorder: A randomized crossover trial.
PG  - 1-29
LID - 10.1017/S0007114522000393 [doi]
AB  - Marine n-3 fatty acids (n-3LCPUFA) have shown neurocognitive benefits in children 
      with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but few trials have examined 
      effects in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We explored, if n-3LCPUFA 
      affect cognitive functions in adults with ASD, and if effects are modified by 
      comorbid ADHD. In a 2x4 week crossover study, 26 participants were randomized to 
      sequence of supplementation with fish oil (FO, 5.2 g/d n-3PUFA) and safflower oil 
      (SO). At baseline and after each period, we measured primary outcomes: attention 
      (d2-test) and spatial working memory (Corsi test) and secondary outcomes: 
      flexibility (Stroop word-colour test), ADHD symptoms (Conners scales), executive 
      functions (Behavioural Inventory of Executive Function) and social behaviour (Social 
      Responsiveness Scale). The dropout rate was 15%. Compliance was 94% and correlated 
      with whole-blood n-3LCPUFA. Corsi scores improved by ∼0.3×SD (P=0.032) after FO vs 
      SO, and the odds for d2 errors were 30% lower (P=0.016), which was supported by 
      improved Conners scores of attention (P=0.023). Improvement in Conners ADHD symptom 
      score was limited to participants with ADHD (-3.5(-6.0;-1.0), n=10 vs 
      -0.2(-2.5;2.2), n=11 without ADHD, Pinteraction=0.096), who also improved their 
      behavioural regulation index by 0.3×SD after FO (Pinteraction=0.016). Participants 
      without ADHD gained most in d2 test performance (OR=0.4(0.2;0.7) vs 0.9(0.6;1.3) in 
      those with ADHD, Pinteraction=0.002), but their executive function score was 
      exacerbated after FO (5.9(0.0,11.8), Pinteraction=0.039). Our results did not show 
      any effects on ASD symptoms, but suggest that FO may improve attention and working 
      memory in adults with ASD and ameliorate ADHD symptoms in those with comorbid ADHD.

TI  - The validation of contemporary body composition methods in various races and 
      ethnicities.
PG  - 1-31
LID - 10.1017/S0007114522000368 [doi]
AB  - Few investigations have evaluated the validity of current body composition 
      technology among racially and ethnically diverse populations. This study assessed 
      the validity of common body composition methods in a multi-ethnic sample stratified 
      by race and ethnicity. 110 individuals (55% female, age: 26.5±6.9 yrs) identifying 
      as Asian, African American/Black, Caucasian/White, Hispanic, Multi-racial, and 
      Native American were enrolled. Seven body composition models (dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry [DXA], air displacement plethysmography [ADP], two bioelectrical 
      impedance devices [BIS, IB] and three multi-compartment models) were evaluated 
      against a four-compartment criterion model by assessing total error (TE) and 
      standard error of the estimate. For the total sample, measures of %fat and fat-free 
      mass (FFM) from multi-compartment models were all excellent to ideal (%fat: 
      TE=0.94-2.37%; FFM: TE=0.72-1.78 kg) compared to the criterion. %fat measures were 
      very good to excellent for DXA, ADP and IB (TE=2.52-2.89%) and fairly good for BIS 
      (TE=4.12%). For FFM, single device estimates were good (BIS; TE = 3.12 kg) to ideal 
      (DXA, ADP, IB; TE = 1.21-2.15 kg). Results did not vary meaningfully between each 
      race and ethnicity, except BIS was not valid for African American/Black, 
      Caucasian/White and Multi-racial participants for %fat (TE=4.3-4.9%). The 
      multi-compartment models evaluated can be utilized in a multi-ethnic sample and in 
      each individual race and ethnicity to obtain highly valid results for %fat and FFM. 
      Estimates from DXA, ADP and IB were also valid. The BIS may demonstrate greater 
      total error for all racial and ethnic cohorts and results should be interpreted 
      cautiously.

TI  - Sun Exposure Is Associated with Reduced Breast Cancer Risk among Women Living in the 
      Caribbean: The Atabey Study in Puerto Rico.
PG  - 430-435
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-21-0932 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Though inconsistent, there is evidence that sun exposure is associated 
      with reduced breast cancer risk. Previous studies have been conducted in 
      geographical regions with seasonal variation in UV radiation, including periods of 
      low to no exposure, and among participants mostly of European descent. Puerto Rico 
      has no significant seasonal fluctuation, with continuous exposure to very high UV 
      radiation. METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study of breast 
      cancer among women in metropolitan San Juan, Puerto Rico, examining a cumulative sun 
      exposure index (SEI) based on a comparison of reflectance of sun-exposed and 
      non-exposed skin. A chromameter was used to measure skin reflectance and estimate 
      the difference between constitutive (unexposed) and facultative (exposed) skin 
      pigmentation in 307 cases and 328 controls. Breast cancer risk factors were 
      ascertained with interviewer-administered questionnaires. OR and 95% confidence 
      intervals (CI) were estimated with unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: 
      Adjusted breast cancer odds were lower for the highest tertile of the SEI (OR(adj) = 
      0.47; 95% CI, 0.29-0.74). Results were similar within strata of estrogen receptor 
      status. In analyses stratified by constitutive skin pigmentation, among participants 
      with darker skin color, breast cancer risk was lower with more sun exposure (OR(adj) 
      = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.16-0.70). CONCLUSIONS: We found lower risk of breast cancer 
      associated with greater sun exposure in a population living with high, continuous 
      sun exposure. This beneficial finding should be placed in the context of other 
      effects of sun exposure. IMPACT: Sun exposure is a modifiable factor that may 
      contribute, directly or indirectly, to lower breast cancer risk.

TI  - Divergent immunometabolic changes in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle with ageing 
      in healthy humans.
PG  - 921-947
LID - 10.1113/JP280977 [doi]
AB  - KEY POINTS: Ageing is associated with increased systemic inflammation and metabolic 
      dysfunction that contributes to the development of age-associated diseases. The role 
      of adipose tissue in immunometabolic alterations that take place with ageing is 
      unknown in humans. We show, in healthy, active and lean older adults, that adipose 
      tissue, but not skeletal muscle, displays considerable pro-inflammatory 
      transcriptomic, cellular and secretory changes, as well as a reduction in insulin 
      signalling proteins compared to younger adults. These findings indicate that adipose 
      tissue undergoes substantial immunometabolic alterations with ageing, and that these 
      changes are tissue-specific and more profound than those observed in skeletal muscle 
      or in the circulation. These results identify adipose tissue as an important tissue 
      in the biological ageing process in humans, which may exhibit signs of 
      immunometabolic dysfunction prior to systemic manifestation. ABSTRACT: Ageing and 
      obesity are both characterized by inflammation and a deterioration in metabolic 
      health. It is now clear that adipose tissue plays a major role in inflammation and 
      metabolic control in obesity, although little is known about the role of adipose 
      tissue in human ageing. To understand how ageing impacts adipose tissue, we 
      characterized subcutaneous adipose tissue and skeletal muscle samples from twelve 
      younger (27 ± 4 years [Young]) and twelve older (66 ± 5 years [Old]) 
      active/non-obese males. We performed a wide-range of whole-body and tissue measures, 
      including RNA-sequencing and multicolour flow cytometry. We also measured a range of 
      inflammatory and metabolic proteins in the circulation and their release by adipose 
      tissue, ex vivo. Both adipose tissue and muscle had ∼2-fold more immune cells per 
      gram of tissue with ageing. In adipose tissue, this immune cell infiltration was 
      driven by increased memory/effector T-cells, whereas, in muscle, the accumulation 
      was driven by memory/effector T-cells and macrophages. Transcriptomic analysis 
      revealed that, with ageing, adipose tissue, but not muscle, was enriched for 
      inflammatory transcripts/pathways related to acquired and innate immunity. Ageing 
      also increased the adipose tissue pro-inflammatory secretory profile. Insulin 
      signalling protein content was reduced in adipose tissue, but not muscle. Our 
      findings indicate that adipose tissue undergoes substantial immunometabolic changes 
      with ageing in humans, and that these changes are tissue-specific and more profound 
      than those observed in the circulation and skeletal muscle.

LID - e0261716
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the incidence rates and predictors of 
      lower limb fractures in a general Japanese population. METHODS: NIPPON DATA is a 
      nationwide, long-term, prospective cohort study of individuals who participated in 
      the National Cardiovascular Survey Japan and the National Nutrition Survey in 1990. 
      Overall, 3,134 individuals (1,827 women, 1,307 men) who participated in follow-up 
      assessments in 1995, 2000, and/or 2006 were included in the present analysis. The 
      outcomes of this study were lower limb fractures (including proximal femur 
      fractures). RESULTS: The mean age at baseline was 63.8 years in women and 63.1 years 
      in men. The average body mass index (BMI) was 23.3 kg/m2 in women and 22.9 kg/m2 in 
      men. During a mean follow-up of 12.1 years, 271 total lower limb fractures were 
      observed. In women, older age, lower BMI, and less intake of vegetables were 
      associated with increased risks of proximal femur fractures. With regard to the 
      outcome of total lower limb fractures, less intake of vegetables and regular 
      exercise were significant predictors in women. Calcium intake was not significantly 
      associated with proximal femur or total lower limb fractures. There were no 
      significant predictors of proximal femur or total lower limb fractures in men, 
      except for age. CONCLUSIONS: Aging was a significant risk factor for proximal femur 
      and total lower limb fractures in both men and women. With regard to modifiable risk 
      factors, low BMI and low intake of vegetables were associated with increased risks 
      of proximal femur and/or total lower limb fractures in the general population of 
      Japanese women.

TI  - Effects of high dairy protein intake and vitamin D supplementation on body 
      composition and cardiometabolic markers in 6-8-y-old children-the D-pro trial.
LID - nqab424 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ajcn/nqab424 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that prevention of lifestyle diseases 
      should begin early. Dairy protein and vitamin D can affect body composition and 
      cardiometabolic markers, yet evidence among well-nourished children is sparse. 
      OBJECTIVES: We investigated combined and separate effects of high dairy protein 
      intake and vitamin D on body composition and cardiometabolic markers in children. 
      METHODS: In a 2 × 2-factorial, randomized trial, 200 white, Danish, 6-8-y-old 
      children substituted 260 g/d dairy in their diet with high-protein (HP, 10 g 
      protein/100 g) or normal-protein (NP, 3.5 g protein/100 g) yogurt and received 
      blinded tablets with 20 µg/d vitamin D3 or placebo for 24 weeks during winter. We 
      measured body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, blood pressure, and 
      fasting blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and lipids. RESULTS: In total, 184 
      children (92%) completed the study. Baseline median [25th-75th percentile] dairy 
      protein intake was 3.7 [2.5-5.1] E% and increased to 7.2 [4.7-8.8] E% and 4.2 
      [3.1-5.3] E% with HP and NP. Mean ± SD serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D changed from 
      81±17 nmol/L to 89±18 nmol/L and 48±13 nmol/L with vitamin D and placebo. There were 
      no combined effects of dairy protein and vitamin D, except for plasma glucose, with 
      the largest increase in the NP-vitamin D group (Pinteraction = 0.005). There were 
      smaller increases in fat mass index (P = 0.04) with HP than NP, and the same pattern 
      was seen for insulin, HOMA-IR, and C-peptide (all P = 0.06). LDL cholesterol was 
      reduced with vitamin D compared to placebo (P < 0.05). Fat free mass and blood 
      pressure were unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: High compared to normal dairy protein intake 
      hampered an increase in fat mass index. Vitamin D supplementation counteracted the 
      winter decline in 25-hydroxyvitamin D and the increase in LDL cholesterol observed 
      with placebo. This study adds to the sparse evidence on dairy protein in 
      well-nourished children and supports a vitamin D intake of around 20 µg/d during 
      winter.

TI  - A physiotherapy-led transition to home intervention for older adults following 
      emergency department discharge: protocol for a pilot feasibility randomised 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 3

AB  - BACKGROUND: Older adults frequently attend the emergency department (ED) and 
      experience high rates of adverse outcomes following ED presentation including 
      functional decline, ED re-presentation and unplanned hospital admission. The 
      development of effective interventions to prevent such outcomes is a key priority 
      for research and service provision. This paper reports a protocol designed to 
      evaluate the feasibility of conducting a three arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) 
      within the ED setting and in the patient's home. The interventions are comprehensive 
      geriatric assessment (CGA), ED PLUS and usual care. METHODS: The ED PLUS pilot trial 
      is designed as a feasibility RCT conducted in the ED and Acute Medical Assessment 
      Unit of a university teaching hospital in the mid-west region of Ireland. We aim to 
      recruit 30 patients, aged 65 years and over presenting to the ED with 
      undifferentiated medical complaints and discharged within 72 h of index visit. 
      Patients will be randomised by a computer in a ratio of 1:1:1 to deliver usual care, 
      CGA or ED PLUS during a 6-month study period. A randomised algorithm is used to 
      perform randomization. CGA will include a medical assessment, medication review, 
      nursing assessment, falls assessment, assessment of mobility and stairs, transfers, 
      personal care, activities of daily living (ADLs), social supports and baseline 
      cognition. ED PLUS, a physiotherapist led, multidisciplinary intervention, aims to 
      bridge the transition of care between the index visit to the ED and the community by 
      initiating a CGA intervention in the ED and implementing a 6-week follow-up 
      self-management programme in the patient's own home following discharge from the ED. 
      The outcomes will be parameters of the feasibility of the intervention and trial 
      methods and will be assessed quantitatively and qualitatively. DISCUSSION: Rising ED 
      visits and an ageing population with chronic health issues render ED interventions 
      to reduce adverse outcomes in older adults a research priority. This feasibility RCT 
      will generate data and experience to inform the conduct and delivery of a definite 
      RCT. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered in Clinical Trials Protocols and 
      Results System as of 21(st) July 2021, with registration number NCT049836020 .

      childhood: A systematic review.

AB  - Individual differences in child eating self-regulation are associated with excess 
      weight gain and may be explained, in part, by the family feeding environment and a 
      child's general propensity to self-regulate outside of the context of eating (i.e., 
      general self-regulation). Several studies have examined the associations between 
      food parenting behaviors, child eating and general self-regulation, and child weight 
      separately. However, there are a paucity of data on whether and how these factors 
      interact to confer risk for weight gain in early childhood. The current systematic 
      review identified 32 longitudinal studies that examined unidirectional or 
      bidirectional associations among one or more of the following paths: food parenting 
      behaviors and child eating self-regulation (path 1); child eating self-regulation 
      and child weight (path 2); child eating self-regulation and child general 
      self-regulation (path 3); food parenting behaviors and child general self-regulation 
      (path 4); and child general self-regulation and child weight (path 5). Results 
      indicated relationships of food parenting behaviors to child eating self-regulation, 
      child weight to child eating self-regulation, and child general self-regulation to 
      child weight. However, there were scant longitudinal data that examined paths 3 and 
      4. Further research on the developmental correlates of child eating self-regulation 
      is needed to identify parent and child targets for early childhood obesity 
      prevention.

TI  - Developing a Culturally Responsive Lifestyle Intervention for Overweight/Obese U.S. 
      Mexicans.
PG  - 28-38
LID - 10.1007/s10900-021-01016-w [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hispanics are the largest minority group in the United States, 
      constituting 18 % of the population. Mexicans are the largest Hispanic subgroup and 
      are at disproportionate risk for overweight/obesity. Lifestyle interventions 
      targeting dietary change and physical activity have resulted in significant weight 
      loss in several large randomized clinical trials in the general population, but few 
      studies have tailored interventions to Mexican Americans. We conducted a community 
      needs assessment from 2018 to 2020 in accordance with Domenech-Rodriguez and 
      Wieling's Cultural Adaptation Process (CAP) model to inform the development of SANOS 
      (SAlud y Nutrición para todOS) (Health and Nutrition for All), a 
      culturally-tailored, community-based diet and lifestyle education and counseling 
      program that addresses overweight/obesity among U.S. Mexicans. METHODS: Five 
      Spanish-language focus groups were conducted until thematic saturation with 31 
      overweight/obese Mexicans in New York City about their knowledge, priorities, and 
      preferences regarding diet, exercise, and evidence-based strategies for behavioral 
      change. A grounded theory approach was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Five 
      themes were identified: (1) A strong desire for tangible information related to diet 
      and health, (2) Family as a primary motivator for behavior change, (3) Desire for 
      group-based motivation and accountability to sustain intervention participation, (4) 
      Belief in short-term goal setting to prevent loss of motivation, and (5) Time and 
      workplace-related barriers to intervention adoption. CONCLUSIONS: Ecological factors 
      such as the effect of acculturation on diet, family members' role in behavior 
      change, and socioenvironmental barriers to healthy dietary practices and physical 
      activity should be considered when adapting evidence-based treatments for Mexican 
      Americans.

TI  - Role of Endothelin-1 Receptors in Limiting Leg Blood Flow and Glucose Uptake During 
      Hyperinsulinemia in Type 2 Diabetes.
LID - bqac008 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/endocr/bqac008 [doi]
AB  - Skeletal muscle insulin resistance is a hallmark of individuals with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2D). In healthy individuals insulin stimulates vasodilation, which is 
      markedly blunted in T2D; however, the mechanism(s) remain incompletely understood. 
      Investigations in rodents indicate augmented endothelin-1 (ET-1) action as a major 
      contributor. Human studies have been limited to young obese participants and focused 
      exclusively on the ET-1 A (ETA) receptor. Herein, we have hypothesized that ETA 
      receptor antagonism would improve insulin-stimulated vasodilation and glucose uptake 
      in T2D, with further improvements observed during concurrent ETA + ET-1 B (ETB) 
      antagonism. Arterial pressure (arterial line), leg blood flow (LBF; Doppler), and 
      leg glucose uptake (LGU) were measured at rest, during hyperinsulinemia alone, and 
      hyperinsulinemia with (1) femoral artery infusion of BQ-123, the selective ETA 
      receptor antagonist (n = 10 control, n = 9 T2D) and then (2) addition of BQ-788 
      (selective ETB antagonist) for blockade of ETA and ETB receptors (n = 7 each). The 
      LBF responses to hyperinsulinemia alone tended to be lower in T2D (controls: 
      ∆161 ± 160 mL/minute; T2D: ∆58 ± 43 mL/minute, P = .08). BQ-123 during 
      hyperinsulinemia augmented LBF to a greater extent in T2D (% change: controls: 
      14 ± 23%; T2D: 38 ± 21%, P = .029). LGU following BQ-123 increased similarly between 
      groups (P = .85). Concurrent ETA + ETB antagonism did not further increase LBF or 
      LGU in either group. Collectively, these findings suggest that during 
      hyperinsulinemia ETA receptor activation restrains vasodilation more in T2D than 
      controls while limiting glucose uptake similarly in both groups, with no further 
      effect of ETB receptors (NCT04907838).

TI  - Perinatal factors, female breast cancer, and associated risk factors in Puerto Rico: 
      evidence from the Atabey epidemiology of breast cancer study.
PG  - 373-379
LID - 10.1007/s10552-021-01531-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: There is increasing evidence that exposures in utero and in infancy impact 
      breast cancer risk. No previous studies have evaluated these associations among 
      women in Puerto Rico. METHODS: In a population-based case-control study of breast 
      cancer epidemiology in the San Juan metropolitan area in Puerto Rico, we examined 
      the association of early life factors with breast cancer risk and breast cancer risk 
      factors. Both cases (n = 315) and controls (n = 348) completed 
      interviewer-administered questionnaires, including self-reported birth country, 
      birthweight, and history of having been breastfed. Comparisons of characteristics of 
      those with and without the early life factors were made with t-tests or chi-squared 
      tests; associations between early life factors and breast cancer risk were estimated 
      with unconditional logistic regression adjusting for age, education, body mass index 
      (BMI), age at menarche, parity, and menopausal status. RESULTS: Women who had been 
      breastfed tended to have higher adult body mass index (BMI), higher education, and 
      lower parity (p < 0.05). Higher birthweight was associated with higher adult BMI and 
      lower educational attainment (p < 0.05). Those born outside of Puerto Rico or the US 
      were more likely to have higher educational attainment and earlier age at menarche 
      than those born within Puerto Rico or the US (p < 0.05). We found no significant 
      associations between any of the early life factors and breast cancer risk. 
      CONCLUSION: We did not find evidence of an association of early life factors with 
      breast cancer risk among women in Puerto Rico.

TI  - An Interactive Voice Response System to Increase Physical Activity and Prevent 
      Cancer in the Rural Alabama Black Belt: Design and Usability Study.
PG  - e29494
LID - 10.2196/29494 [doi]
LID - e29494
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased physical activity (PA) levels are associated with reduced risk 
      and improved survival for several cancers; however, most Americans engage in less 
      than the recommended levels of PA. Using interactive voice response (IVR) systems to 
      provide personalized health education and counseling may represent a high-reach, 
      low-cost strategy for addressing physical inactivity and cancer disparities in 
      disproportionately burdened rural regions. However, there has been a paucity of 
      research conducted in this area to date. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to 
      design, develop, and test the usability of an IVR system aimed at increasing PA 
      levels in the rural Alabama Black Belt. METHODS: A pilot version of the IVR system 
      was used to assess initial feasibility and acceptability. Detailed exit interviews 
      were conducted to elicit participant feedback, which helped inform the development 
      of a substantially upgraded in-house IVR system. This refined IVR system was then 
      subjected to a sequential explanatory mixed methods evaluation. Participating rural 
      county coordinators and research staff (N=10) tested the usability of the IVR system 
      features for 2 weeks and then completed the System Usability Scale and qualitative 
      semistructured interviews. RESULTS: The study sample comprised mostly African 
      American people, women, rural county coordinators, and research staff (N=10). 
      Participants rated the IVR system with a mean score of 81 (SD 5) on the System 
      Usability Scale, implying excellent usability. In total, 5 overarching themes 
      emerged from the qualitative interviews: likes or dislikes of the intervention, 
      barriers to or facilitators of PA, technical difficulties, quality of calls, and 
      suggestions for intervention improvement. Message framing on step feedback, call 
      completion incentives, and incremental goal-setting challenges were areas identified 
      for improvement. The positive areas highlighted in the interviews included the 
      personalized call schedules, flexibility to call in or receive a call, ability to 
      make up for missed calls, narration, and PA tips. CONCLUSIONS: The usability testing 
      and feedback received from the rural county coordinators and research staff helped 
      inform a final round of refinement to the IVR system before use in a large 
      randomized controlled trial. This study stresses the importance of usability testing 
      of all digital health interventions and the benefits it can offer to the 
      intervention.

AB  - Activation of the sympathetic nervous system causes pronounced metabolic changes 
      that are mediated by multiple adrenergic receptor subtypes. Systemic treatment with 
      β(2-)adrenergic receptor agonists results in multiple beneficial metabolic effects, 
      including improved glucose homeostasis. To elucidate the underlying cellular and 
      molecular mechanisms, we chronically treated wild-type mice and several newly 
      developed mutant mouse strains with clenbuterol, a selective β(2)-adrenergic 
      receptor agonist. Clenbuterol administration caused pronounced improvements in 
      glucose homeostasis and prevented the metabolic deficits in mouse models of β-cell 
      dysfunction and insulin resistance. Studies with skeletal muscle-specific mutant 
      mice demonstrated that these metabolic improvements required activation of skeletal 
      muscle β(2)-adrenergic receptors and the stimulatory G protein, G(s). Unbiased 
      transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses showed that chronic β(2)-adrenergic receptor 
      stimulation caused metabolic reprogramming of skeletal muscle characterized by 
      enhanced glucose utilization. These findings strongly suggest that agents targeting 
      skeletal muscle metabolism by modulating β(2)-adrenergic receptor-dependent 
      signaling pathways may prove beneficial as antidiabetic drugs.

TI  - Associations of A Body Shape Index (ABSI) with Cancer Incidence, All-Cause, and at 
      23 Sites-Findings from the UK Biobank Prospective Cohort Study.
PG  - 315-324
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-21-0591 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have explored the emerging adiposity marker A Body Shape 
      Index (ABSI) with cancer risk. This study investigated the associations between ABSI 
      and the incidence of cancer at 23 sites and all cancer combined. METHODS: Data from 
      442,610 participants from the UK Biobank prospective study were included in this 
      study. ABSI was used as the exposure. Incidence of cancer at 23 sites was the 
      outcome. Cox proportional hazard models were performed to explore the association of 
      ABSI, and combined ABSI and body mass index (BMI) with cancer risk, after adjusting 
      for multiple testing. RESULTS: 36,961 individuals developed cancer during the 8.8 
      years median follow-up. In multivariable analyses, participants in the highest 
      tertile of ABSI had higher risk of lung [HR, 1.58; 95% confidence interval (CI), 
      1.44-1.74], liver (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.18-1.77), esophagus (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 
      1.12-1.57), colorectal (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.10-1.28), and breast (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 
      1.04-1.17) cancers, and all cancers combined (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.08-1.14) compared 
      with the lowest tertile. These associations remained significant after adjustment 
      for BMI. When ABSI was combined with BMI, participants in the highest ABSI who also 
      had a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2) were at higher risk of uterus, esophagus, liver, stomach, 
      colorectal, and breast cancers, as well as all cancers combined, compared with those 
      in the lowest ABSI tertile with a normal BMI. CONCLUSIONS: ABSI is associated with 
      an increased risk of five cancers as well as all cancers combined, independently of 
      BMI. IMPACT: ABSI is a useful marker for adiposity. However, cancer risk prediction 
      improves with the combination of BMI.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Elevated circulating levels of complement component 3 (C3) and 
      C-reactive protein (CRP) have been linked with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Lifestyle 
      interventions may hold potential to ameliorate these effects. We investigated the 
      effect of an antenatal healthy lifestyle intervention on maternal C3 and CRP 
      concentrations and assessed their relationship with maternal and fetal metabolic 
      markers and outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data from the Pregnancy 
      Exercise And Nutrition Research Study (PEARS) randomized controlled trial. METHODS: 
      Women (n = 406) with C3 and CRP concentrations determined in early pregnancy 
      (14-16 weeks) and/or late pregnancy (28-weeks) with corresponding fasting glucose, 
      insulin, c-peptide, and lipid profiles were included in the analysis. Pregnancy 
      outcomes included: diagnoses of gestational diabetes (GDM), pre-eclampsia (PET) or 
      pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), pre-term birth (delivery < 37 weeks), low 
      birth weight (<2500 g), small-for-gestational age (SGA) defined using < 5th or 10th 
      centile for birthweight and cord blood measures of glucose and lipid metabolism. 
      T-tests investigated changes in C3 and CRP over time. Chi-square, Pearson's' 
      correlations and multiple regression investigated relationships with outcomes. 
      RESULTS: The PEARS intervention did not influence maternal C3 or CRP concentrations 
      in pregnancy. There was no relationship between CRP concentrations and any maternal 
      or infant outcome. Women who developed GDM had higher C3 concentrations in early 
      (p = 0.01) and late pregnancy (p = 0.02). Women who developed PIH/PET had lower C3 
      concentrations in early (p = 0.02), but not late (p = 0.10) pregnancy. Maternal C3 
      concentrations in early pregnancy were a small but significant predictor of maternal 
      insulin concentrations in early (β = 0.40, 95% CI 0.27, 0.53; p < 0.001) and late 
      (β = 0.30, 95% CI 0.17, 0.43p < 0.001) pregnancy, early total cholesterol (TC), and 
      both early and late triglycerides, LDL and HDL Cholesterol concentrations (all 
      p < 0.001). Women who delivered SGA babies (<10th centile) had lower C3 
      concentrations than women who did not in both early (p < 0.001) and late pregnancy 
      (p = 0.01). No relationship between maternal C3 or CRP and fetal glucose 
      concentrations or lipid profiles was observed. CONCLUSION: Maternal C3 may play a 
      role in multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes including cardiometabolic ill-health. 
      Further research on this, and strategies to reduce C3 in a pregnant population, are 
      warranted.

AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are highly prevalent in Asia. 
      Understanding the pathophysiology of abnormal glucose homeostasis in Asians will 
      have important implications for reducing disease burden, but there have been 
      conflicting reports on the relative contributions of insulin secretion and action in 
      disease progression. In this study, we aimed to assess the contribution of β-cell 
      dysfunction and insulin resistance in the Asian prediabetes phenotype. METHODS: We 
      recruited 1679 Asians with prediabetes (n = 659) or normoglycemia (n = 1020) from a 
      multi-ethnic population in Singapore. Participants underwent an oral glucose 
      tolerance test, an intravenous glucose challenge, and a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic 
      clamp procedure to determine glucose tolerance, β-cell responsivity, insulin 
      secretion, insulin clearance and insulin sensitivity. RESULTS: Participants with 
      prediabetes had significantly higher glucose concentrations in the fasting state and 
      after glucose ingestion than did normoglycemic participants. Insulin sensitivity 
      (M/I ratio) was ~15% lower, acute insulin response (AIR) to intravenous glucose and 
      β-cell responsivity to oral glucose were ~35% lower, but total insulin secretion 
      rate in the fasting state and after glucose ingestion was ~10% greater in 
      prediabetic than in normoglycemic participants. The decrease in β-cell function with 
      worsening glucose homeostasis in Asians with prediabetes was associated with 
      progressively greater defects in AIR rather than M/I. However, analysis using static 
      surrogate measures (HOMA indices) of insulin resistance and β-cell function revealed 
      a different pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Lower AIR to intravenous glucose and β-cell 
      responsivity to oral glucose, on a background of mild insulin resistance, are the 
      major contributors to the dysregulation of glucose homeostasis in Asians with 
      prediabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Experimental studies of time-restricted eating suggest that 
      limiting the daily eating window, shifting intake to the biological morning, and 
      avoiding eating close to the biological night may promote metabolic health and 
      prevent weight gain. SUBJECTS/METHODS: We used the Eating & Health Module of the 
      2006-2008 and 2014-2016 American Time Use Survey to examine cross-sectional 
      associations of timing of eating in relation to sleep/wake times as a proxy for 
      circadian timing with body mass index (BMI). The analytical sample included 38 302 
      respondents (18-64 years; BMI 18.5-50.0 kg/m(2)). A single 24-hour time use diary 
      was used to calculate circadian timing of eating variables: eating window (time 
      between first and last eating activity); morning fast (time between end of sleep and 
      start of eating window); and evening fast (time between end of eating window and 
      start of sleep). Multinomial logistic regression and predictive margins were used to 
      estimate adjusted population prevalences (AP) by BMI categories and changes in 
      prevalences associated with a one-hour change in circadian timing of eating, 
      controlling for sociodemographic and temporal characteristics. RESULTS: A one-hour 
      increase in eating window was associated with lower adjusted prevalence of obesity 
      (AP = 27.1%, SE = 0.1%). Conversely, a one-hour increase in morning fast 
      (AP = 28.7%, SE = 0.1%) and evening fast (AP = 28.5%, SE = 0.1%) were each 
      associated with higher prevalence of obesity; interactions revealed differing 
      patterns of association by combination of eating window with morning/evening fast 
      (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to hypotheses, longer eating windows were 
      associated with a lower adjusted prevalence of obesity and longer evening fasts were 
      associated with a higher prevalence of obesity. However, as expected, longer morning 
      fast was associated with a higher adjusted prevalence of obesity. Studies are needed 
      to disentangle the contributions of diet quality/quantity and social desirability 
      bias in the relationship between circadian timing of eating and BMI.

AB  - Adhering to specific dietary patterns might hold promise as a lifestyle modification 
      treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this systematic 
      review was to examine the effect of dietary patterns on changes in hepatic fat 
      content, liver enzymes and metabolic syndrome components. We searched Pubmed, 
      Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science for randomised controlled trials published in 
      English until April 2020, comparing a specific dietary pattern with no treatment, 
      usual care, or a different diet in adults with NAFLD. Studies were included if NAFLD 
      had been diagnosed using biopsy, magnetic resonance imaging, or proton magnetic 
      resonance spectroscopy. Data from three trials in adults with NAFLD but without 
      diabetes (n = 128; mean age 49.9 ± 5.0 years, range 42-55 years) were included in 
      the qualitative synthesis; across them, risk of bias was considered low, unclear and 
      high for 33%, 38% and 29% of domains, respectively. There was moderate evidence that 
      a low-carbohydrate, compared to a low-calorie diet (-27%, P = 0.008, one study, 
      n = 18) and the Mediterranean, compared to a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet (-4.4%, 
      P = 0.030, one study, n = 12) result in greater reductions in hepatic fat content, 
      but no such evidence was found for the Fatty Liver in Obesity dietary pattern (based 
      on the principles of the Mediterranean diet), compared to the American Heart 
      Association diet (-0.6%, P = 0.706, one study, n = 98). No between-group differences 
      were reported for other outcomes across studies. A post hoc analysis, including two 
      eligible studies assessing the effect of the Mediterranean, compared to a low-fat 
      diet, irrespective of baseline presence of diabetes, showed strong evidence that the 
      Mediterranean diet reduces hepatic fat content (-4.1%, 95% CI = -5.8 to -2.3, 
      P < 0.001; I(2) = 0%) and triglyceride concentrations (-16.9 mg/dL, 95% CI = -26.3 
      to -7.7, P < 0.001; I(2) = 0%). Well-designed, adequately powered and rigorous 
      randomised controlled trials are needed to provide robust evidence on the effect of 
      these dietary patterns, but also other whole dietary approaches, on NAFLD 
      progression.

TI  - Low iodine diet advice and differentiated thyroid cancer treatment: A historic 
      exploration in three UK centres.
PG  - 315-320
LID - S2405-4577(21)01130-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.11.026 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Patients with differentiated thyroid cancer are often advised 
      to follow a low iodine diet (LID) one to two weeks before radioiodine remnant 
      ablation (RRA). We describe treatment practices and ablation success rates in 
      centres (C1, C2, C3) in the UK with different approaches to LID advice. METHODS: 
      Historic cohort of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer treated with RRA in 
      2015/16 in C1 (n = 50, 1-week LID), C2 (n = 59, 2-week LID) and C3 (n = 108, no LID 
      advice). Response to RRA was stratified as excellent, indeterminate, or incomplete 
      by the adapted American Thyroid Association Dynamic Risk Stratification Score. 
      RESULTS: There was little difference in age, sex and staging between centres, but 
      the percentage receiving 1.1 GBq vs higher administered activities differed (C1:22%, 
      C2:44%, C3:15%, p < 0.001). Excellent response was recorded for: C1:48%, C2:36%, 
      C3:49% (p = 0.61). Differences in RRA preparation and outcome assessment at C3 
      precluded comparison across all centres. Adjusted odds ratio for excellent response 
      at C2 vs C1 was 0.57 (95%CI: 0.25,1.32), p = 0.19. CONCLUSIONS: There was no 
      evidence that advising a LID for 2-weeks before RRA improves outcomes compared to 
      1-week. For definitive recommendations on LIDs prior to RRA, a prospective 
      multi-centre study with a more homogenous approach to patient management or, 
      randomised controlled trial, is needed.

TI  - Network Analyses Reveal Negative Link Between Changes in Adipose Tissue GDF15 and 
      BMI During Dietary-induced Weight Loss.
PG  - e130-e142
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgab621 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Adipose tissue (AT) transcriptome studies provide holistic pictures of 
      adaptation to weight and related bioclinical settings changes. OBJECTIVE: To 
      implement AT gene expression profiling and investigate the link between changes in 
      bioclinical parameters and AT gene expression during 3 steps of a 2-phase dietary 
      intervention (DI). METHODS: AT transcriptome profiling was obtained from sequencing 
      1051 samples, corresponding to 556 distinct individuals enrolled in a weight loss 
      intervention (8-week low-calorie diet (LCD) at 800 kcal/day) followed with a 6-month 
      ad libitum randomized DI. Transcriptome profiles obtained with QuantSeq sequencing 
      were benchmarked against Illumina RNAseq. Reverse transcription quantitative 
      polymerase chain reaction was used to further confirm associations. Cell specificity 
      was assessed using freshly isolated cells and THP-1 cell line. RESULTS: During LCD, 
      5 modules were found, of which 3 included at least 1 bioclinical variable. Change in 
      body mass index (BMI) connected with changes in mRNA level of genes with 
      inflammatory response signature. In this module, change in BMI was negatively 
      associated with changes in expression of genes encoding secreted protein (GDF15, 
      CCL3, and SPP1). Through all phases of the DI, change in GDF15 was connected to 
      changes in SPP1, CCL3, LIPA and CD68. Further characterization showed that these 
      genes were specific to macrophages (with LIPA, CD68 and GDF15 expressed in 
      anti-inflammatory macrophages) and GDF15 also expressed in preadipocytes. 
      CONCLUSION: Network analyses identified a novel AT feature with GDF15 upregulated 
      with calorie restriction induced weight loss, concomitantly to macrophage markers. 
      In AT, GDF15 was expressed in preadipocytes and macrophages where it was a hallmark 
      of anti-inflammatory cells.

LID - 10.1136/heartjnl-2021-320356 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes of children with rheumatic 
      heart disease (RHD) in Uganda, and determine characteristics that predict adverse 
      outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated the risk of death in 
      Ugandan children with clinical RHD from 2010 to 2018; enrolling children aged 5-18 
      years old from an existing registry. Demographic data and clinical data (baseline 
      complications, RHD severity, cardiac interventions) were collected. The primary 
      outcome was survival. Univariable and multivariable hazard ratios (HR) were obtained 
      from Cox proportional hazards regression. Survival probabilities were developed 
      using Kaplan-Meier curves; log-rank tests compared survival based on cardiac 
      interventions, disease severity and time of enrolment. RESULTS: 612 cases met 
      inclusion criteria; median age 12.8 years (IQR 5.3), 37% were male. Thirty-one per 
      cent (187 of 612) died during the study period; median time to death 7.8 months (IQR 
      18.3). In univariable analysis, older age (HR 1.26, 95% CI=1.0 to 1.58), presence of 
      baseline complications (HR 2.06, 95% CI=1.53 to 2.78) and severe RHD (HR 5.21, 95% 
      CI=2.15 to 12.65) were associated with mortality. Cardiac intervention was 
      associated with a lower risk of mortality (HR 0.06, 95% CI=0.02 to 0.24). In 
      multivariable models, baseline complications (HR 1.78, 95% CI=1.31 to 2.41), severe 
      RHD (HR 4.58, 95% CI=1.87 to 11.23) and having an intervention (HR 0.05, 95% CI=0.01 
      to 0.21) remained statistically significant. Kaplan-Meier survival curves 
      demonstrated >25% mortality in the first 30 months, with significant differences in 
      mortality based on intervention status and severity of disease. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      mortality rate of children with clinical RHD in Uganda exceeds 30%, over an 8-year 
      time frame, despite in-country access to cardiac interventions. Children at highest 
      risk were those with cardiac complications at baseline and severe RHD.

TI  - Implementation and prospective evaluation of the Country Heart Attack Prevention 
      model of care to improve attendance and completion of cardiac rehabilitation for 
      patients with cardiovascular diseases living in rural Australia: a study protocol.
PG  - e054558
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054558 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite extensive evidence of its benefits and recommendation by 
      guidelines, cardiac rehabilitation (CR) remains highly underused with only 20%-50% 
      of eligible patients participating. We aim to implement and evaluate the Country 
      Heart Attack Prevention (CHAP) model of care to improve CR attendance and completion 
      for rural and remote participants. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: CHAP will apply the model 
      for large-scale knowledge translation to develop and implement a model of care to CR 
      in rural Australia. Partnering with patients, clinicians and health service 
      managers, we will codevelop new approaches and refine/expand existing ones to 
      address known barriers to CR attendance. CHAP will codesign a web-based CR programme 
      with patients expanding their choices to CR attendance. To increase referral rates, 
      CHAP will promote endorsement of CR among clinicians and develop an electronic 
      system that automatises referrals of in-hospital eligible patients to CR. A business 
      model that includes reimbursement of CR delivered in primary care by Medicare will 
      enable sustainable access to CR. To promote CR quality improvement, professional 
      development interventions and an accreditation programme of CR services and 
      programmes will be developed. To evaluate 12-month CR attendance/completion (primary 
      outcome), clinical and cost-effectiveness (secondary outcomes) between patients 
      exposed (n=1223) and not exposed (n=3669) to CHAP, we will apply a multidesign 
      approach that encompasses a prospective cohort study, a pre-post study and a 
      comprehensive economic evaluation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved 
      by the Southern Adelaide Clinical Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/20/SAC/78) 
      and by the Department for Health and Wellbeing Human Research Ethics Committee 
      (2021/HRE00270), which approved a waiver of informed consent. Findings and 
      dissemination to patients and clinicians will be through a public website, online 
      educational sessions and scientific publications. Deidentified data will be 
      available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. TRIAL REGISTRATION

TI  - Consistent gut bacterial and short-chain fatty acid signatures in hypoabsorptive 
      bariatric surgeries correlate with metabolic benefits in rats.
PG  - 297-306
LID - 10.1038/s41366-021-00973-5 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study aimed at comparing how changes in the gut microbiota are 
      associated to the beneficial effects of the most clinically efficient hypoabsorptive 
      bariatric procedures, namely Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), biliopancreatic 
      diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) and single anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass 
      with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S). METHODS: Diet-induced obese (DIO) male Wistar rats 
      were divided into seven groups. In addition to the groups subjected to RYGB, BPD-DS 
      and SADI-S, the following four control groups were included: SHAM-operated rats fed 
      a high-fat diet (SHAM HF), SHAM fed a low-fat diet (SHAM LF), SHAM HF-pair-weighed 
      to BPD-DS (SHAM HF-PW) and sleeve-gastrectomy (SG) rats. Body weight, food intake, 
      glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity/resistance, and L-cell secretion were 
      assessed. The gut microbiota (16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing) as well as the 
      fecal and cæcal contents of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were also analyzed prior 
      to, and after the surgeries. RESULTS: The present study demonstrates the beneficial 
      effect of RYGB, BPD-DS and SADI-S on fat mass gain and glucose metabolism in DIO 
      rats. These benefits were proportional to the effect of the surgeries on food 
      digestibility (BPD-DS > SADI-S > RYGB). Notably, hypoabsorptive surgeries led to 
      consonant microbial signatures characterized by decreased abundance of the 
      Ruminococcaceae (Oscillospira and Ruminococcus), Oscillospiraceae (Oscillibacter) 
      and Christensenellaceae, and increased abundance of the Clostridiaceae 
      (Clostridium), Sutterellaceae (Sutterella) and Enterobacteriaceae. The gut bacteria 
      following hypoabsorptive surgeries were associated with higher fecal levels of 
      propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate and isovalerate. Increases in the fecal SCFAs were 
      in turn positively and strongly correlated with the levels of peptide 
      tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) and with the beneficial effects of the surgery. CONCLUSION: 
      The present study emphasizes the consistency with which the three major 
      hypoabsorptive bariatric procedures RYGB, BPD-DS and SADI-S create a gut microbial 
      environment capable of producing a SCFA profile favorable to the secretion of PYY 
      and to beneficial metabolic effects.

TI  - Genetically determined blood lead is associated with reduced renal function amongst 
      individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus: insight from Mendelian Randomisation.
PG  - 125-134
LID - 10.1007/s00109-021-02152-5 [doi]
AB  - Some observational studies indicate a link between blood lead and kidney function 
      although results remain controversial. In this study, Mendelian randomisation (MR) 
      analysis was applied to obtain unconfounded estimates of the casual association of 
      genetically determined blood lead with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 
      and the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Data from the largest genome-wide 
      association studies (GWAS) on blood lead, eGFR and CKD, from predominantly 
      ethnically European populations, were analysed in total, as well as separately in 
      individuals with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Inverse variance weighted 
      (IVW) method, weighted median (WM)-based method, MR-Egger, MR-Pleiotropy RESidual 
      Sum and Outlier (PRESSO) as well as the leave-one-out method were applied. In a 
      general population, lifetime blood lead levels had no significant effect on risk of 
      CKD (IVW: p = 0.652) and eGFR (IVW: p = 0.668). After grouping by type 2 diabetes 
      status (no diabetes vs. diabetes), genetically higher levels of blood lead had a 
      significant negative impact among subjects with type 2 diabetes 
      (IVW = Beta: -0.03416, p = 0.0132) but not in subjects without (IVW: p = 0.823), 
      with low likelihood of heterogeneity for any estimates (IVW p > 0.158). MR-PRESSO 
      did not highlight any outliers. Pleiotropy test, with very negligible intercept and 
      insignificant p-value, indicated a low likelihood of pleiotropy for all estimations. 
      The leave-one-out method demonstrated that links were not driven by a single SNP. 
      Our results show, for the first time, that among subjects with type 2 diabetes, 
      higher blood lead levels are potentially related to less favourable renal function. 
      Further studies are needed to confirm our results. KEY MESSAGES: What is already 
      known about this subject? Chronic kidney disease is associated with unfavourable 
      lifestyle behaviours and conditions such as type 2 diabetes. Observational studies 
      have reported an association between blood lead and reduced estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate, but the relationship between lead exposure and renal function 
      remains controversial. What is the key question? Using Mendelian randomisation with 
      data from 5433 individuals from the UK and Australian populations, does genetically 
      determined blood lead have a potentially causal effect on estimated glomerular 
      filtration rate and the risk of chronic kidney disease? What are the new findings? 
      Blood lead levels have a potentially causal effect on reduced renal function in 
      individuals with type 2 diabetes. In subjects without diabetes, no such causal 
      relationship was identified. How might this impact on clinical practice in the 
      foreseeable future? This highlights the risk of elevated blood lead, for example, 
      due to environmental exposure, amongst those with type 2 diabetes, which may 
      predispose them to impaired renal function.

TI  - Lifestyle modification for weight loss: Effects on cardiorespiratory capacity in 
      patients with class II and class III obesity.
PG  - 45-55
LID - 10.1002/osp4.544 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity has increased worldwide. Obesity affects the 
      lungs and airways, limits peak oxygen uptake, and hampers physical performance; 
      however, objective data are scarce. Does lifestyle modification for weight loss (LM) 
      have an impact on cardiorespiratory capacity (CRC) in patients with class II and 
      class III obesity? METHOD: This was a single-center prospective 2-year follow-up 
      pilot study. Four separated stays in the inpatient specialized medical center 
      Muritunet with an integrated approach to LM, including an individual plan on diet 
      and physical activity (PA) goals. Furthermore, it included lectures and counseling 
      on human anatomy and physiology, nutrition, physical exercise, and motivation, as 
      well as daily PA. Cardiopulmonary and blood chemistry tests were conducted. RESULTS: 
      Seventy-seven participants were included; however, 47% (n = 36) dropped out during 
      follow-up. Forty-one participants completed the study. At baseline (BL), the mean 
      age was 45.4 (SD 10.2, range 23-62) years, with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 41.3 
      (SD 5.4) kg/m(2), and 85% (n = 35) had one or more comorbidities, such as 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 15, 37%), obstructive sleep apnea (n = 19, 46%), 
      type 2 diabetes (n = 20, 49%), and hypertension (n = 17, 41%). The mean functional 
      residual capacity increased, significantly the second year (p = 0,037). CRC 
      increased significantly the first year (p = 0.032). Weight and BMI declined, 
      reaching statistical significance at 2 years for both males and females (p = 0.033 
      and p = 0.003, respectively). At BL, the participants reported lower health-related 
      quality of life compared to the general Norwegian population. Across time the 
      physical component summary score (quality of life) for both males and females 
      (p = 0.011 and p = 0.049, respectively) increased significantly. CONCLUSION: 
      Lifestyle modification for weight loss improves CRC in patients with class II and 
      class III obesity.

TI  - Prospective association between a Mediterranean-style dietary score in childhood and 
      cardiometabolic risk in young adults from the ALSPAC birth cohort.
PG  - 737-752
LID - 10.1007/s00394-021-02652-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the prospective association between a children's relative 
      Mediterranean-style diet score (C-rMED) in childhood and a Cardiometabolic Risk 
      (CMR) score in adolescence/young adulthood in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents 
      and Children (ALSPAC). METHODS: A C-rMED was calculated at 7, 10 and 13 years from 
      diet diary data. Anthropometric and biochemical data at 17 (N = 1940) and 24 years 
      (N = 1961) were used to calculate CMR scores (sum of sex-specific log-transformed 
      z-scores from triacylglycerol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, mean arterial blood 
      pressure, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and fat mass 
      index (FMI)). Adjusted logistic regression models examined associations between 
      C-rMED (categorical and 2-unit increments) and a high CMR score (≥ 80th percentile) 
      and individual CMR components (≥ 80th percentile). RESULTS: A high C-rMED at 13 was 
      associated with a 32% (OR 0.68 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.94)) decreased adjusted odds of 
      having a high CMR score at 24 years, compared to participants with a low C-rMED. No 
      associations were evident at other ages. Tracking of the C-rMED across the three 
      ages showed a stronger negative association between C-rMED and CMR at 24 years when 
      children had at least two high C-rMED scores from 7 to 13 years (adjusted OR: 0.49, 
      95% CI: 0.29, 0.85), compared to all low scores. FMI and HOMA-IR were the main CMR 
      components contributing to this association. CONCLUSION: Higher Mediterranean-style 
      diet scores in early adolescence were associated with a better CMR profile in young 
      adults (24 year olds). This underscores the importance of establishing healthy 
      eating habits early in life for future cardiometabolic health.

TI  - Muscular Fitness and Cardiometabolic Variables in Children and Adolescents: A 
      Systematic Review.
LID - 10.1007/s40279-021-01631-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of muscular fitness (MF) in the performance of activities 
      of daily living is unequivocal. Additionally, emerging evidence has shown MF can 
      reduce cardiometabolic risk in children and adolescents. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of 
      this study was to examine and summarize the evidence regarding the relationship 
      between MF phenotypes (i.e., maximum muscular strength/power, muscular endurance, 
      and maximum muscular strength/power/endurance) and cardiometabolic variables 
      (obesity, blood pressure, lipids, glucose homeostasis, inflammatory markers, and 
      clustered cardiometabolic variables) in children and adolescents. DESIGN: This 
      systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for 
      Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and was registered with 
      PROSPERO, number CRD42020179273. DATA SOURCES: A systematic review was performed on 
      five databases (PubMed, EMBASE, SciELO, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge) from database 
      inception to May 2020, with complementary searches in reference lists. ELIGIBILITY 
      CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Eligibility criteria included (1) a study sample of 
      youth aged ≤ 19 years, (2) an assessment of MF with individual or clustered 
      cardiometabolic variables derived from adjusted models (regardless of 
      test/measurement adopted or direction of reported association), and (3) a report of 
      the association between both, using observational studies. Only original articles 
      published in peer-reviewed journals in English, Portuguese, and Spanish languages 
      were considered. The quality of the included studies was assessed by using the 
      National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute checklist. The percentage of results 
      reporting a statistically significant inverse association between each MF phenotype 
      and cardiometabolic variables was calculated. RESULTS: Of the 23,686 articles 
      initially identified, 96 were included (77 cross-sectional and 19 longitudinal), 
      with data from children and adolescents from 35 countries. The score for the quality 
      of evidence ranged from 0.33 to 0.92 (1.00 maximum). MF assessed by maximum muscular 
      strength/power was inversely associated with lower obesity (64/113 total results 
      (56.6%)) and reduction in clustered cardiometabolic risk (28/48 total results 
      (58.3%)). When assessed by muscular endurance, an inverse association with obesity 
      (30/44 total results (68.1%)) and cardiometabolic risk (5/8 total results (62.5%)) 
      was identified. Most of the results for the relationship between MF phenotypes with 
      blood pressure, lipids, glucose homeostasis, and inflammatory markers indicated a 
      paucity of evidence for these interrelationships (percentage of results below 
      50.0%). CONCLUSION: MF assessed by maximum muscular strength/power or muscular 
      endurance is potentially associated with lower obesity and lower risk related to 
      clustered cardiometabolic variables in children and adolescents. There is limited 
      support for an inverse association between MF with blood pressure, lipids, glucose 
      homeostasis biomarkers, and inflammatory markers in children and adolescents.

TI  - Describing Transitions in Adherence to Physical Activity Self-monitoring and Goal 
      Attainment in an Online Behavioral Weight Loss Program: Secondary Analysis of a 
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
PG  - e30673
LID - 10.2196/30673 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Standard behavioral weight loss interventions often set uniform physical 
      activity (PA) goals and promote PA self-monitoring; however, adherence remains a 
      challenge, and recommendations may not accommodate all individuals. Identifying 
      patterns of PA goal attainment and self-monitoring behavior will offer a deeper 
      understanding of how individuals adhere to different types of commonly prescribed PA 
      recommendations (ie, minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA] and 
      daily steps) and guide future recommendations for improved intervention 
      effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: This study examined weekly patterns of adherence to 
      step-based and minute-based PA goals and self-monitoring behavior during a 6-month 
      online behavioral weight loss intervention. METHODS: Participants were prescribed 
      weekly PA goals for steps (7000-10,000 steps/day) and minutes of MVPA (50-200 
      minutes/week) as part of a lifestyle program. Goals gradually increased during the 
      initial 2 months, followed by 4 months of fixed goals. PA was self-reported daily on 
      the study website. For each week, participants were categorized as adherent if they 
      self-monitored their PA and met the program PA goal, suboptimally adherent if they 
      self-monitored but did not meet the program goal, or nonadherent if they did not 
      self-monitor. The probability of transitioning into a less adherent status was 
      examined using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Participants (N=212) were 
      predominantly middle-aged females with obesity, and 67 (31.6%) self-identified as a 
      racial/ethnic minority. Initially, 73 (34.4%) participants were categorized as 
      adherent to step-based goals, with 110 [51.9%] suboptimally adherent and 29 [13.7%] 
      nonadherent, and there was a high probability of either remaining suboptimally 
      adherent from week to week or transitioning to a nonadherent status. However, 149 
      (70.3%) participants started out adherent to minute-based goals (34 [16%] 
      suboptimally adherent and 29 [13.7%] nonadherent), with suboptimally adherent seen 
      as the most variable status. During the graded goal phase, participants were more 
      likely to transition to a less adherent status for minute-based goals (odds ratio 
      [OR] 1.39, 95% CI 1.31-1.48) compared to step-based goals (OR 1.24, 95% CI 
      1.17-1.30); however, no differences were seen during the fixed goal phase 
      (minute-based goals: OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.05-1.08; step-based goals: OR 1.07, 95% CI 
      1.05-1.08). CONCLUSIONS: States of vulnerability to poor PA adherence can emerge 
      rapidly and early in obesity treatment. There is a window of opportunity within the 
      initial 2 months to bring more people toward adherent behavior, especially those who 
      fail to meet the prescribed goals but engage in self-monitoring. Although this study 
      describes the probability of adhering to step- and minute-based targets, it will be 
      prudent to determine how individual characteristics and contextual states relate to 
      these behavioral patterns, which can inform how best to adapt interventions. TRIAL

TI  - Effect of Arterial Stiffness and Carotid Intima-Media Thickness Progression on the 
      Risk of Dysglycemia, Insulin Resistance, and Dyslipidemia: a Temporal Causal 
      Longitudinal Study.
PG  - 667-678
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.121.18754 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the temporal causal longitudinal associations of 
      carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV), a measure of arterial stiffness, and 
      carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) progression with the risk of dysglycemia, 
      insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. METHODS: We included 3862, 17.7-year-old, 
      participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, followed up 
      for 7 years. cfPWV, cIMT, and fasting plasma samples were repeatedly measured. We 
      computed homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) of insulin resistance and percent 
      pancreatic beta-cell function. Data were analyzed using logistic regression, linear 
      mixed-effect, and cross-lagged structural equation models. RESULTS: A higher cfPWV 
      at 17.7 years was associated with higher insulin at age 24.5 years (odds ratio, 1.25 
      [CI, 1.08-1.44]; P=0.003), which slightly attenuated after covariates adjustment. 
      Higher cIMT at 17.7 years was associated with lower insulin (odds ratio, 0.06 
      [0.01-0.95]; P=0.046) at 24.5 years, after covariate adjustments. In mixed-effect 
      models, the 7-year progression in cfPWV (predictor) was directly associated with the 
      increase in triglyceride (outcome). cIMT progression was associated with the 7-year 
      increase in LDL (low-density lipoprotein), triglyceride, and glucose. In 
      cross-lagged models, higher cfPWV at 17.7 years was associated with higher insulin 
      (β=0.06, SE, 0.12, P=0.014), HOMA of insulin resistance, and HOMA-percent pancreatic 
      beta-cell function at 24.5 years. However, insulin, HOMA of insulin resistance, and 
      HOMA-percent pancreatic beta-cell function at 17.7 years were not associated with 
      cfPWV at 24.5 years. Higher cIMT at 17.7 years was associated with reduced insulin, 
      HOMA of insulin resistance, and HOMA-percent pancreatic beta-cell function at 24.5 
      years, but not vice versa. Higher glucose at 17.7 years was associated with higher 
      cfPWV and cIMT at 24.5 years only. CONCLUSIONS: Arterial stiffness in adolescence 
      may be a causal risk factor for hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in young 
      adulthood.

TI  - Effects of Arterial Stiffness and Carotid Intima-Media Thickness Progression on the 
      Risk of Overweight/Obesity and Elevated Blood Pressure/Hypertension: a Cross-Lagged 
      Cohort Study.
PG  - 159-169
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.121.18449 [doi]
AB  - We examined the temporal longitudinal associations of carotid-femoral pulse wave 
      velocity (cfPWV), a measure of arterial stiffness, and carotid intima-media 
      thickness (cIMT) with the risk of overweight/obesity and elevated blood pressure 
      (BP)/hypertension. We studied 3862 adolescents aged 17.7 years from the Avon 
      Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, followed-up for 7 years. cfPWV and cIMT 
      were measured by ultrasound. Total and trunk fat mass and lean mass were assessed by 
      dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Body mass index and BP were measured. Data were 
      analyzed using logistic regression, linear mixed-effect, and cross-lagged structural 
      equation models, with covariate adjustments. Among 1719 male and 2143 female 
      participants, higher cfPWV at 17.7 years was associated with the risk of elevated 
      systolic BP/hypertension (odds ratio, 1.20 [1.02-1.41]; P=0.026), elevated diastolic 
      BP/hypertension (1.77 [1.32-2.38]; P<0.0001), body mass index-overweight/obesity 
      (1.19 [1.01-1.41]; P=0.041), and trunk fat mass overweight/obesity (1.24 
      [1.03-1.49]; P=0.023) at 24.5 years. Higher cIMT at 17.7 years had no associations 
      with obesity and elevated BP at follow-up. cfPWV progression was directly associated 
      with 7-year increase in systolic BP (effect estimate 16 mm Hg [9-24]; P<0.0001) and 
      diastolic BP (28 mm Hg [23-34]; P<0.0001). cIMT progression was directly associated 
      with the 7-year increase of all adiposity measures and diastolic BP. In the temporal 
      analysis, baseline cfPWV was directly associated with follow-up systolic and 
      diastolic BP, however, baseline BP was unassociated with follow-up cfPWV. cfPWV but 
      not cIMT was bidirectionally associated with adiposity. Obesity and hypertension 
      prevention from adolescence may require developing novel approaches to mitigate 
      arterial stiffness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of supplementing unscreened adults with vitamin D(3) on 
      mortality is unclear. We aimed to determine whether monthly doses of vitamin D(3) 
      influenced mortality in older Australians. METHODS: We did a randomised, 
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral vitamin D(3) supplementation (60 000 
      IU per month) in Australians 60 years or older who were recruited across the country 
      via the Commonwealth electoral roll. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), 
      using automated computer-generated permuted block randomisation, to receive one oral 
      gel capsule of either 60 000 IU vitamin D(3) or placebo once a month for 5 years. 
      Participants, staff, and investigators were blinded to study group allocation. The 
      primary endpoint was all-cause mortality assessed in all participants who were 
      randomly assigned. We also analysed mortality from cancer, cardiovascular disease, 
      and other causes. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were generated using flexible 
      parametric survival models. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand 
      Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12613000743763. FINDINGS: Between Feb 14, 2014, and 
      June 17, 2015, we randomly assigned 21 315 participants, including 10 662 to the 
      vitamin D group and 10 653 to the placebo group. In 4441 blood samples collected 
      from randomly sampled participants (N=3943) during follow-up, mean serum 
      25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentrations were 77 (SD 25) in the placebo group and 115 (SD 
      30) nmol/L in the vitamin D group. Following 5 years of intervention (median 
      follow-up 5·7 years [IQR 5·4-6·7]), 1100 deaths were recorded (placebo 538 [5·1%]; 
      vitamin D 562 [5·3%]). 10 661 participants in the vitamin D group and 10 649 
      participants in the placebo group were included in the primary analysis. Five 
      participants (one in the vitamin D group and four in the placebo group) were not 
      included as they requested to be withdrawn and their data to be destroyed. The HR of 
      vitamin D(3) effect on all-cause mortality was 1.04 [95% CI 0·93 to 1·18]; 
      p=0·47)and the HR of vitamin D(3) effect on cardiovascular disease mortality was 
      0·96 (95% CI 0·72 to 1·28; p=0·77). The HR for cancer mortality was 1·15 (95% CI 
      0·96 to 1·39; p=0·13) and for mortality from other causes it was 0·83 (95% CI 0·65 
      to 1·07; p=0·15). The odds ratio for the per-protocol analysis was OR 1·18 (95% CI 
      1·00 to 1·40; p=0·06). In exploratory analyses excluding the first 2 years of 
      follow-up, those randomly assigned to receive vitamin D had a numerically higher 
      hazard of cancer mortality than those in the placebo group (HR 1·24 [95% CI 
      1·01-1·54]; p=0·05). INTERPRETATION: Administering vitamin D(3) monthly to 
      unscreened older people did not reduce all-cause mortality. Point estimates and 
      exploratory analyses excluding the early follow-up period were consistent with an 
      increased risk of death from cancer. Pending further evidence, the precautionary 
      principle would suggest that this dosing regimen might not be appropriate in people 
      who are vitamin D-replete. FUNDING: The D-Health Trial is funded by National Health 
      and Medical Research Council.

PG  - e13373
LID - 10.1111/obr.13373 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the effectiveness 
      of e-health interventions for the treatment of children and adolescents with 
      overweight or obesity. Databases were searched up to November 2020. Studies were 
      randomized controlled trials where interventions were delivered via e-health (e.g., 
      computers, tablets, and smartphones, but not phone calls). Studies should target the 
      treatment of overweight or obesity in children or their agent of changes and report 
      body mass index (BMI) or BMI z-score. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model 
      was conducted. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria, and 60% were of high 
      quality. The narrative review revealed variation in behavior change strategies and 
      modes of delivery. The pooled mean reduction in BMI or BMI z-score showed evidence 
      for a nonzero effect (standardized mean difference = -0.31, 95% confidence interval 
      -0.49 to -0.13), with moderately high heterogeneity between studies (I(2)  = 74%, 
      p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed high heterogeneity in studies with a high or 
      unclear risk of bias. E-health interventions can be effective in treating children 
      and adolescents with overweight and obesity and should be considered by 
      practitioners and policymakers. However, an understanding of the most effective and 
      acceptable intervention components, long-term benefits, and sustainability should be 
      further studied.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate relationships between takeaway food and sugar-sweetened 
      beverage (SSB) consumption with cardiometabolic phenotypes during childhood and 
      mid-adulthood. METHOD: Design: Cross-sectional Child Health CheckPoint within the 
      national population-representative Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. 
      Participants: 1838 children (mean age 11.5 years; 49.1% female) and 1846 adults 
      (mean age 43.7 years; 87.6% female). Exposures: Self-reported takeaway food and SSB 
      consumption ('frequent': ≥ weekly). Outcomes: Functional (pulse wave velocity (PWV), 
      blood pressure (BP)) and structural (carotid intima-media thickness, retinal 
      microvascular calibre) preclinical cardiovascular phenotypes; lipids (total 
      cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), 
      triglycerides). Analysis: Linear regression (exposure: takeaway or SSB consumption, 
      individually or together) adjusted for age, sex and socio-economic position; and 
      mediation analysis for body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: Associations were small among 
      children (standardized mean difference (SMD) ≤0.15). In adults, associations were 
      stronger with functional, but not structural, cardiovascular phenotypes and lipids, 
      particularly for frequent takeaway food consumption (e.g. PWV (0.20 m/s; 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 0.03 to 0.37); systolic (3.3 mmHg; 95% CI 1.3 to 5.3) and 
      diastolic BP (1.4 mmHg; 95% CI 0.2 to 2.6); LDL (0.10 mmol/L; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.18); 
      HDL (-0.14 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.19 to -0.10) and triglycerides (0.30 mmol/L; 95% CI 
      0.12 to 0.48)]. BMI mediated associations between takeaway food consumption and PWV, 
      BP, HDL and TG (proportion of mediation 34% to 75%), while mediation effects were 
      smaller for SSB consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent takeaway food consumption in 
      adults was associated with adverse blood lipids and vascular function (mainly via 
      BMI). Lack of strong associations in children highlights opportunities for 
      prevention.

TI  - Linking Physical Activity to Breast Cancer via Sex Hormones, Part 1: The Effect of

PG  - 16-27
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-21-0437 [doi]
AB  - The effect of physical activity on breast cancer risk may be partly mediated by sex 
      steroid hormones. This review synthesized and appraised the evidence for an effect 
      of physical activity on sex steroid hormones. Systematic searches were performed 
      using MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and SPORTDiscus to identify experimental 
      studies and prospective cohort studies that examined physical activity and 
      estrogens, progestins, and/or androgens, as well as sex hormone binding globulin 
      (SHBG) and glucocorticoids in pre- and postmenopausal women. Meta-analyses were 
      performed to generate effect estimates. Risk of bias was assessed, and the GRADE 
      system was used to appraise quality of the evidence. Twenty-eight randomized 
      controlled trials (RCT), 81 nonrandomized interventions, and six observational 
      studies were included. Estrogens, progesterone, and androgens mostly decreased, and 
      SHBG increased, in response to physical activity. Effect sizes were small, and 
      evidence quality was graded moderate or high for each outcome. Reductions in select 
      sex steroid hormones following exercise supports the biological plausibility of the 
      first part of the physical activity-sex hormone-breast cancer pathway. The confirmed 
      effect of physical activity on decreasing circulating sex steroid hormones supports 
      its causal role in preventing breast cancer.See related reviews by Lynch et al., p. 
      11 and Drummond et al., p. 28.

TI  - 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are inversely related to metabolic syndrome risk profile 
      in northern Chinese subjects without vitamin D supplementation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The comparatively low 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels have been 
      reported in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Herein we investigated the 
      cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between serum 25(OH)D levels and MetS 
      risk profile in northern middle-aged Chinese subjects without vitamin D 
      supplementation. METHODS: A cohort of 211 participants including 151 MetS patients 
      and 60 controls at 20-69 years of age were enrolled from suburban Beijing, China. 
      The recruited MetS patients were subjected to diet and exercise counselling for 
      1-year. All subjects at baseline and MetS patients after intervention underwent 
      clinical evaluations. RESULTS: Serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly decreased in 
      MetS patients. 25(OH)D levels were inversely related to MetS score, fasting blood 
      glucose (FBG) and triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) after adjusting for cofounders 
      (all P < 0.05). Participants in the lowest tertile of 25(OH)D levels had increased 
      odds for MetS (P = 0.045), elevated FBG (P = 0.004) in all subjects, and one MetS 
      score gain in MetS patients (P = 0.005). Longitudinally, the metabolic statuses as 
      well as 25(OH)D levels of MetS patients were significantly improved (all P < 0.05), 
      and the increase of 25(OH)D levels were inversely related to MetS scores, total 
      cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), FBG, and TyG, while 
      positively related to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) after adjusting 
      for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: 25(OH)D levels were significantly decreased in MetS 
      patients, and it was negatively associated with metabolic dysfunctions at baseline 
      and 1-year after. Metabolic aberrations of MetS patients were significantly 
      ameliorated with 1-year follow-up counselling accompanying by notably elevated 
      25(OH)D levels.

TI  - PGC1α Regulates the Endothelial Response to Fluid Shear Stress via Telomerase 
      Reverse Transcriptase Control of Heme Oxygenase-1.
PG  - 19-34
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.121.317066 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fluid shear stress (FSS) is known to mediate multiple phenotypic changes 
      in the endothelium. Laminar FSS (undisturbed flow) is known to promote endothelial 
      alignment to flow, which is key to stabilizing the endothelium and rendering it 
      resistant to atherosclerosis and thrombosis. The molecular pathways responsible for 
      endothelial responses to FSS are only partially understood. In this study, we 
      determine the role of PGC1α (peroxisome proliferator gamma coactivator-1α)-TERT 
      (telomerase reverse transcriptase)-HMOX1 (heme oxygenase-1) during shear stress in 
      vitro and in vivo. Approach and Results: Here, we have identified PGC1α as a 
      flow-responsive gene required for endothelial flow alignment in vitro and in vivo. 
      Compared with oscillatory FSS (disturbed flow) or static conditions, laminar FSS 
      (undisturbed flow) showed increased PGC1α expression and its transcriptional 
      coactivation. PGC1α was required for laminar FSS-induced expression of TERT in vitro 
      and in vivo via its association with ERRα(estrogen-related receptor alpha) and KLF 
      (Kruppel-like factor)-4 on the TERT promoter. We found that TERT inhibition 
      attenuated endothelial flow alignment, elongation, and nuclear polarization in 
      response to laminar FSS in vitro and in vivo. Among the flow-responsive genes 
      sensitive to TERT status, HMOX1 was required for endothelial alignment to laminar 
      FSS. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest an important role for a PGC1α-TERT-HMOX1 axis 
      in the endothelial stabilization response to laminar FSS.

TI  - Cystamine reduces vascular stiffness in Western diet-fed female mice.
PG  - H167-H180
LID - 10.1152/ajpheart.00431.2021 [doi]
AB  - Consumption of diets high in fat, sugar, and salt (Western diet, WD) is associated 
      with accelerated arterial stiffening, a major independent risk factor for 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Women with obesity are more prone to develop arterial 
      stiffening leading to more frequent and severe CVD compared with men. As tissue 
      transglutaminase (TG2) has been implicated in vascular stiffening, our goal herein 
      was to determine the efficacy of cystamine, a nonspecific TG2 inhibitor, at reducing 
      vascular stiffness in female mice chronically fed a WD. Three experimental groups of 
      female mice were created. One was fed regular chow diet (CD) for 43 wk starting at 4 
      wk of age. The second was fed a WD for the same 43 wk, whereas a third cohort was 
      fed WD, but also received cystamine (216 mg/kg/day) in the drinking water during the 
      last 8 wk on the diet (WD + C). All vascular stiffness parameters assessed, 
      including aortic pulse wave velocity and the incremental modulus of elasticity of 
      isolated femoral and mesenteric arteries, were significantly increased in WD- versus 
      CD-fed mice, and reduced in WD + C versus WD-fed mice. These changes coincided with 
      respectively augmented and diminished vascular wall collagen and F-actin content, 
      with no associated effect in blood pressure. In cultured human vascular smooth 
      muscle cells, cystamine reduced TG2 activity, F-actin:G-actin ratio, collagen 
      compaction capacity, and cellular stiffness. We conclude that cystamine treatment 
      represents an effective approach to reduce vascular stiffness in female mice in the 
      setting of WD consumption, likely because of its TG2 inhibitory capacity.NEW & 
      NOTEWORTHY This study evaluates the novel role of transglutaminase 2 (TG2) 
      inhibition to directly treat vascular stiffness. Our data demonstrate that 
      cystamine, a nonspecific TG2 inhibitor, improves vascular stiffness induced by a 
      diet rich in fat, fructose, and salt. This research suggests that TG2 inhibition 
      might bear therapeutic potential to reduce the disproportionate burden of 
      cardiovascular disease in females in conditions of chronic overnutrition.

AB  - Achondroplasia, the most common skeletal dysplasia, is characterized by a variety of 
      medical, functional and psychosocial challenges across the lifespan. The condition 
      is caused by a common, recurring, gain-of-function mutation in FGFR3, the gene that 
      encodes fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. This mutation leads to impaired 
      endochondral ossification of the human skeleton. The clinical and radiographic 
      hallmarks of achondroplasia make accurate diagnosis possible in most patients. 
      However, marked variability exists in the clinical care pathways and protocols 
      practised by clinicians who manage children and adults with this condition. A group 
      of 55 international experts from 16 countries and 5 continents have developed 
      consensus statements and recommendations that aim to capture the key challenges and 
      optimal management of achondroplasia across each major life stage and sub-specialty 
      area, using a modified Delphi process. The primary purpose of this first 
      International Consensus Statement is to facilitate the improvement and 
      standardization of care for children and adults with achondroplasia worldwide in 
      order to optimize their clinical outcomes and quality of life.

TI  - Risk of Fasting and Non-Fasting Hypertriglyceridemia in Coronary Vascular Disease 
      and Pancreatitis.
BTI - Endotext
AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a major cause of mortality in the Western world 
      and in spite of the reduction of CVD risk by the use of lipid lowering agents per 
      current treatment goals there remains substantial residual and absolute risk of CVD 
      in high-risk populations. Focus on elevated triglyceride (TG) levels deserves 
      renewed attention, particularly as one-third of all adults in the United States 
      suffer from elevated TG and a growing number of people are diagnosed with metabolic 
      syndrome or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The dyslipidemia of metabolic syndrome 
      and T2DM is characterized by low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) 
      concentrations and marked elevations in triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TRL). There 
      has been growing data that points towards an association of fasting and non-fasting 
      triglycerides with CVD, including a number of genetic studies suggesting causality. 
      However, the association of TG as an independent risk faster in CVD is confounded by 
      its inverse metabolic relationship with high density lipoprotein (HDL-c) and the 
      heterogeneity of TG lipoproteins. Current guidelines suggest diagnosis of 
      hypertriglyceridemia based on fasting levels where length of fast is recommended to 
      be 9-12 hours. Although non-fasting TG levels may be a better indicator of risk, the 
      lack of standardization of non-fasting TG measurements, lack of specific reference 
      ranges, and the variability of postprandial lipid measurements have hampered their 
      routine clinical use. Current guidelines focus mainly on LDL-c levels; however, 
      lowering TG may provide additional benefit for CVD prevention. Lifestyle changes 
      including dietary changes and exercise play an important role in treatment of 
      hyperlipidemia. Pharmacological agents used in treatment of hypertriglyceridemia 
      include niacin, fibrates, fish oil and statins. Most guidelines recommend treating 
      elevated TG for prevention of pancreatitis. This article will discuss the role of 
      elevated TG in pancreatitis and CVD risk. For complete coverage of all related areas
